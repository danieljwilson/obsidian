# Notes

Suicide prediction...

Ideation
- passive
- active

Ideation -> attempt

Affective control: Hot Executive Functions

Endophenotypes: Heritable
- neurocognition
- trait impulsivity

Stress responsive and non-stress responsive ideation subtypes



## Thoughts
- what if you dream about being killed or killing yourself?
- what about tom sawyer
- prediction issue with ideation or transitioning from ideation to attempt
- capability vs. likelihood?
- intervene...
- '
- information sampling...only perceptual information

- prediction is at chance...

- is fearlessness of death actually a good quality, even if it is also associated with suicide attempt?
	- something else that is the determining factor...
