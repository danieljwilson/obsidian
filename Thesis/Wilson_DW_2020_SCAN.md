## Reviewer 1
### Overall
Need to clarify:
- Timeline of study
	- when assessments happened with respect to each other
	- what happened pre, during and post-scan
	- Figure
- Define **transient** and **lasting**
- Clarify **liking** vs. **tastiness** ratings (also **wanting**)
- What ratings are being entered in the models...
- 

### Methods
- More detail is needed regarding the participants. 
	- For example, what was their race/ethnicity? How were they recruited?
		- Don't quote, just include information
- Was a power analysis conducted to determine the sample size a priori?
	- If not, how was the N determined?
		- Based off of previous studies...both of our own and others...largest N consistent with budget...determined a priori
- The overview section states that the subjects “rated a set of foods for momentary liking.” Further reading of the methods reveals that these are the same 270 stimuli that were used in the regulation task, however that information would be beneficial to the reader’s understanding of the overall study design if presented in the overview as well.
	- Could just say "Done"
- In the Cognitive Regulation Task, was each food type and/or stimulus only seen under one instruction?
	- Yes...we clarified that
- While the overview states that the Liking Rating Task is administered before and after the scanning session, it may be easier for the reader if the fact that this is a non-scanner task is repeated in the description of the task.
	- Yes, Done
- Were the stimuli shown in the Liking Rating Task identical to the 270 used in the Cognitive Regulation Task? I assume so, but it would be helpful to explicitly say.
	- confirm that this was the case...
- In the Attribute Ratings Task description, the authors say that “participants viewed all foods again” – was this the 135 foods or the 270 stimuli (all foods seen in two different amounts)?
	- Clarify that it was the 270 stim...
- How do the authors operationalize “transience” or “durability” of liking (or alternately, self-regulation)? Since this is a main outcome of the current study, a clear explanation in the methods section of how these effects are defined is needed.
	- Clarify...
- Was FMRIPREP run using the default (or most common) settings? While the FMRIPREP details are useful, it would help the reader to interpret the methods if deviations from the defaults are noted.
	- Clarify...
- How many runs were removed due to >30% of excluded frames? How many subjects were removed due to having more than 3/9 runs removed? I assume this is the same number listed in the participants section, but it would be helpful to repeat this information on p. 15.
	- Done
- How were parameter contrast estimates extracted?
	- (cendri can add)

### Results
- It might be useful for future meta-analyses, etc. for the authors to include tables summarizing the results of the whole-brain GLMs.
	- Add this

### Discussion
- The authors do a lovely job of synthesizing the present findings with the current literature and motivating future directions. However, the discussion lacks mention of any limitations of the study, and would benefit from balancing the implications of these findings with any shortcomings of the present work.
	- examining experimenter imposed regulation...
		- state induction
	- transience is not very long...don't test for longer lasting outcomes
	- focused on two regions...other areas that are important?

### General
- There are spelling and punctuation errors throughout the manuscript.

## Reviewer 2
We appreciate the reviewers conditional possitivety and have addressed...
### Issues
- most prominent issue for this reviewer was the use of post-task ratings of tastiness and healthiness as predictors of brain activity during the previously-administered task (pre-task ratings are not described and thus no pre- to post-task changes in healthiness and tastiness). Since the regulatory task conditions are known to influence such ratings (and in some cases like HEALTH, were designed to directly influence such ratings), the prediction would more appropriate in the opposite direction – whereby regulatory instructions led to neural changes (e.g., in dlPFC), which influenced post-task ratings. While some of the analyses/results may still be amenable to this order issue (e.g., decision value), others seem circular/reversed in their current form (e.g., delta liking, sensitivity, and descriptive/interpretive statements such as “tastiness influenced choices more strongly…” “lasting changes in concern for tastiness…”).     
	- Think a bit about this...
	- We do have other studies in this vein where we took tastiness and healthiness ratings twice (those were very stable/highly correlated)...therefore not an issue. Think the attributes are stable, the weights change...
	- Researchers often take attribute ratings after the fact...not inconsistent with the literature (find studies that do that)
	- Can add this to the limitations (attribute only taken afterwards...can't capture changes) Future research would have to address this possibility

- One technical issue that made the results less easy to follow is that it was not always clear which values/equations was being used in each analysis. It would **help if each equation in the methods was numbered**, and then referred to explicitly in the results when it is used.
	- Do that

- One conceptual issue is that the authors focus in both title and abstract on the idea of **transient** vs. **lasting** regulatory effects, which – once I got to the methods and results – I found to be potentially misleading. Indeed, the “lasting” aspect refers to changes in the “liking rating task” from pre- to post-fMRI, which still seems rather transient (even if not immediate, as changes occurring during the task itself). How long after the task was the second rating task? Perhaps the authors can clarify the timing and (unless this several is hours later) can tone down the “lasting” language (“immediate vs. **delayed**” may be a better fit?).
	- Compute the length of time between seeing the food in task vs. seeing it afterwards. Or look at start and end of both tasks. (Gap added by the extra tasks)..30-45 minutes...but emperiaclly check.
	- change in words makes sense

- This reviewer also noted some confusion between and interchangeable use of preference, liking, and wanting/craving. The authors describe a “liking rating task,” which participants completed both before and after the fMRI task. In this task, participants rated “how much they would like to eat the food right now.” In my humble opinion, this seems more consistent with a motivational “wanting” or craving question – especially in the presence of a food cue – even if the wording is “liking.” They also refer to these same ratings as preferences in multiple places including the abstract and discussion. This type of confusion is unfortunately a common issue in the literature (e.g., Pool et al 2016 in Neuroscience and Biobehavioral reviews, and see also Havermans 2012, Appetite), and **would benefit from a brief acknowledgement, discussion, and clarification**. It might be particularly relevant as the DECREASE instruction makes direct reference to decreasing craving, and likely affects those ratings (although this is not reported, see below, please report this in supplementary). 
	- Try to be more clear on this...

- Psychologically, it is unclear to me what participants were doing during “DECREASE” trials. If there is a longer version of the instructions, it would be helpful to append it so the reader can evaluate. Further, did you collect any data on what the participants implemented during this condition? This might shed light on how participants were doing when they were told to “avoid any craving or emotional response to the food while choosing.” I’m not sure how I would implement this instruction myself.
	- Can give full instructions in an appendix

**Given the issues I noted so far, and until I have some clarifications, I am unable to review the discussion at this time, although it seems thoughtful and interesting.**
	- Thank you, with these clarifications we hope the reviewer will be able to provide comments on the discussion.

### Additional (minor) points:
- The paper needs some copyediting. There are several issues with references (e.g., p. 6, p. 10), including some that do not appear in the reference section (e.g., Schmidt et al 2018, Rogers and Monsell, 1995). There are also some typos (e.g., “assocation” on p. 4).

- In the “stimuli” section, the authors describe using a set of 135 foods in two quantities, yielding 270 unique images. This set is described again almost in the same exact words in a subsequent section. This is unnecessary and confusing. Also, I have never considered clam juice to be a food, so this particular choice was slightly puzzling.
	- Can fix...can mention the clam juice thing

- What are the sources of the stimuli? As they are described to “cover the full range of healthiness and tastiness,” it would be good to clarify whether they were pre-piloted to cover this range and provide relevant data (even if in a supplementary material).
	- This was pre-piloted (how to be more exact about this)

- Some sentences in the results were confusing, especially where interactions are noted (e.g., p. 22 “interaction effect of condition”).
	- look through this

- It would be relevant to report the effect of condition on change in “liking” from baseline to post-task, especially given the instructions of the DECREASE condition.
	- do this

- The correlational analysis on the bottom of p. 24 initially confused me. I thought it described a trial-by-trial analysis (“we asked whether goal-consistent changes in the vmPFC or dlPFC predict the durability or transience of regulatory effects”), but the stats suggest this was an individual difference analysis.
	- clarify

- The wording on the number of participants could use clarification – I believe you collected data from 64 participants and excluded 14 of those to end up with N=50? 
	- clarify

- It is interesting that you report a decrease in dlPFC during the DECREASE condition relative to NATURAL. While this is consistent with Hutcherson 2012, some others have reported increases in dlPFC during cognitive regulation in the presence of food (e.g., Kober 2010, Volkow 2011, Yokum 2013, Giuliani 2014, etc), and I would be curious to hear your thoughts on this.
	- add comment in discussion

- **Additional analyses** related to what people chose in each conditions, and questions related to amount would be nice to have in a supplementary results section.
	- include analyses so editor/reviewer can see what it looks like but perhaps point out that it might not be that meaningful for paper

- I personally found the use of “scanning sessions” in the methods to be confusing – I think you use “**scanning session**” to describe what I’ve typically seen described as “**runs**” within the same session. I have most often seen “scanning sessions” as describing fMRI scans taken on different days.
	- Okay

- On p. 10, “Foods were assigned to each condition for each subject such that baseline liking ratings were matched across conditions” – this is noted prior to describing the rating task, so when I first read it, I found it confusing. You might just want to add “(see below)”? This is not necessary, just a suggestion. 
	- Sure

- On p. 11, “To examine how choice behavior changed during cognitive regulation” – you can’t technically measure change, but rather differences, especially as it refers to decision value.
	- sure use "differed"

- Again in a supplement, it would be helpful to elaborate on what you did with frames showing displacement in runs that were not excluded.
	- okay

- On p. 15, please clarify if in regressors R4-R6 the parametric modulators were for each specific trial or for the trial type as noted?
	- Cendri thinks it was for each specific trial

- On p. 15, how many motion parameters? Six? Six and their derivatives? Squares?
	- Cendri have to take a look

- In the results, Figure 2 is never mentioned. Instead, I believe you use Figure 1 where you mean Figure 2 (e.g., p. 21, Figure 1a,c; Figure 1b).
	- Double check
	- maybe only need to alter figure 1

# Discussion

> The objective of the present manuscript is to investigate how brain activity associated with the regulation of dietary decision making affects longer-term food preferences. Overall, I found this to be a well-written manuscript describing a well-designed study, and one that I think advances the literature in this area. 

We thank the reviewer for...
> I suggest revising the text to improve clarity of some important constructs, especially the present operationalization of “durability” and “transience” of self-regulatory effects. There are also some additional areas that I think would benefit from clarification, which I detail below:

We think we have been able to address the concerns...

- can describe changes or QUOTE changes.
	- generally for small change "quote", large change, summarize
