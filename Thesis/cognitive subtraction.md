# Notes
>In [[fMRI]] studies, cognitive subtraction refers to an aspect of experimental design involving the comparison of two conditions or brain states that are presumed to differ in only one discrete feature (the [[independent variable]]). Cognitive subtraction designs rely on the assumption of [[pure insertion]] â€“ the notion that a single cognitive process can be inserted into a task without affecting the remaining processes, or that there are no interactions among the cognitive components of a task.
