# Notes
We have different in cognitive processes.

[[system 1|System 1]]
- rapid
- automatic
- parallel processing
- intuitive processes
- autonomous
- doens't require [[working memory]]
- [[model-free]]
- [[habitual behavior]]

[[system 2|System 2]]
- slower
- analytic
- serial processing
- deliberative processes 
- engages in mental simulation (which requires a model)
- requires [[working memory]]
- [[model-based]]
- [[goal directed behavior]]

**Note**: The two systems are not fully distinct categories (Evans and Stanovich, 2013)
- focus on typical correlates of each kind of process rather than a list of features.
