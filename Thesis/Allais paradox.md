# Notes
Consists of two choice problems:

**Problem 1.** 
Choose between:
**A**:	One million dollars for sure
**B**:	.89 probability of one million dollars
.10 probability of five million dollars
	.01 probability of nothing
	
**Problem 2**. 
Choose between:
**C**:  .11 probability of one million dollars
.89 probability of nothing
**D**:  .10 probability of five million dollars
.90 probability of nothing

- Most people go for A nad D, but this violates the [[independence axiom]].
- Most explanations involve the assumption that the individual incorporates psychological factors such as [[regret]] into their evaluation of the options. This could be considered a [[context effects|contextual effect]].
