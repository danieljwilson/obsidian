[[Sally problem]]

# Notes
This is a re-imagining of the Sally problem as in Lawson (2020) that is aiming for transparency while still testing the [[conjunction bias]].

**Question**
> Imagine Sally owns a car. 
Rank the following from most likely (=1) to least likely (=3):
(1) The car has Bluetooth speakers.
(2) The car is painted green.
(3) The car has Bluetooth speakers and is paintedgreen.

Compared to the [[Linda problem]], there is less material provided with which to form an impression of Sally and the types of activities she might engage in. The Sally problem is **transparent**, so we count a person as having some access to the rule if he or she ==judges the third option as the least likely==.
