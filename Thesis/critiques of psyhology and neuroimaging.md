>Unlike lepidopterists, who have the relatively simple task of gathering and classifying butterflies, psy-chologists have few such convenient physical anchors. Organizing the myriad proposed psychologicalcomponents—“butterflies”—of our minds has been and is one of the great unfulfilled challenges of ourscience. Indeed, it is not only unfulfilled; it has not, in my opinion, been adequately engaged. Rather,hypothetical psychological constructs are invented ad lib and ad hoc without adequate considerationof the fundamental issue of the very plausibility of precise definition. (William Uttal (2001), The New Phrenology p. 90)

>cognitive neuroscience is awash in a sea of conflicting terms and concepts ([[Poldrack_RA_2016_From Brain Maps to Cognitive Ontologies]] p. 588)
