# Notes
## Summary
**Model**: Bounded Meta-Learned Inference

**Idea**: People chose [[strategy selection|decision strategies]] based on:
- their current environment
- minimizing computational resources

"Rediscovers" two proposed heuristic strategies:
- [[one reason decision making heuristic|One reason decision making]]
	requires knowledge of correct ranking of attributes
- [[equal weighting heuristic|Equal weighting]]
requires knowledge of the *direction* of the attributes

If neither of these are used then default is [[weighted combination of multiple attributes]]

[[ideal observer|Ideal observer]] perspective: people weight different attributes of each option appropriately to combine information from all available source

[[heuristics|Heuristic]] as [[ecologically rational strategy]]

[[meta-learning|Meta-learning]] as theory of human behavior. 

A fruitful approach could be to focus on [[decision environment|environment]]. 
- i.e. What environments explain behavior if we assume [[ecological rationality]] and [[resource rationality]] on the part of the agent?

## Thoughts
Hm. Not sure I buy it.

But do agree that the interaction of [[environment structure]], i.e. the [[decision environment]] and [[human computational capabilities]] is where the action is.
