# Notes
## Summary
**Model**: Bounded Meta-Learned Inference

**Idea**: People chose [[strategy selection|decision strategies]] based on:
- their current environment
- minimizing computational resources

- "Rediscovers" two proposed heuristic strategies:
	- [[one reason decision making heuristic|One reason decision making]]
		- requires knowledge of correct ranking of attributes
	- [[equal weighting heuristic|Equal weighting]]
		- requires knowledge of the *direction* of the attributes

- If neither of these are used then default is [[weighted combination of multiple attributes]]
- [[ideal observer|Ideal observer]] perspective: people weight different attributes of each option appropriately to combine information from all available source
- [[heuristics|Heuristic]] as [[ecologically rational strategy]]
