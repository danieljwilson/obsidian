# Notes
## Summary
**Goal**
Behavioral researchers often seek to experimentally manipulate, measure and analyze [[latent psychological attributes]] (e.g. [[memory]], [[self confidence|confidence]], [[attention]]).

**Issue**
[[measurement methods]] in experimental research are often based on tradition and are not consistent between communities...

**Partial Solution**
They propose [[retrodictive validity]]^[this seems like an extremely confusing description of their method] as a means of optimizing measurement strategies and quantifying uncertainty in measurement.


## Thoughts
Had high hopes for this paper. Didn't really seem to live up to them as far as I can tell...
