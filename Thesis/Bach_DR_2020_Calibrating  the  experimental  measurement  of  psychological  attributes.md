# Notes
## Summary
**Big Picture Goal**
Behavioral researchers often seek to experimentally manipulate, measure and analyze [[latent psychological attributes]] (e.g. [[memory]], [[self confidence|confidence]], [[attention]]).

**Issue**
[[measurement methods]] in experimental research are often based on tradition and are not consistent between communities...[[measurement error]] can be same order of magnitude as the effects we are trying to study.

Need to know whether measurements are **meaningful** and **accurate**.

**Research Goal**
Reduce [[measurement error]]. Improve [[accuracy]].
Field of [[metrology]] (pscyh version = [[psychometrics]]) is concerned with this goal.

**Proposed Partial Solution**
They propose [[retrodictive validity]]^[this seems like an extremely confusing description of their method] as a means of optimizing measurement strategies and quantifying uncertainty in measurement.

#### Worked Example
- create aversive associations experimentally (electric shock: [[conditioned stimulus]])
	- cs+ = shock
	- cs- = no shock
- seek to reduce the association with novel method (in comparison with control group)
- measurement is skin conductance

Use the control group to define the transformation performed on the data where the cs+ trials should map to 1 and the cs- trials to 0. This is what they call [[retrodictive validity]].
- This is a **calibration experiment**
- This is also dependent on matching the CS-US ([[conditioned stimulus]]/[[unconditioned stimulus]]) interval
- Essentially mapping **measured values** to **intended values**

**Assumptions**
- real-valued "true" scores of a psychological attribute (exist)
- these values are measurable
- these values are on an interval scale ^[seems the least likely of the assumptions - don't typical think of psychological attributes as being on an interval scale]

## Thoughts
Had high hopes for this paper. Didn't really seem to live up to them as far as I can tell...
