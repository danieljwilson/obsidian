# Notes
Uses  each  successive  cue  to  whittle  away  the  set  of possible  categories  to  which  the  object  in  question  could belong,  until  only  a  **single  possible  category  remains**.

In the real world could be used to **quickly** *categorize* whether an approaching person is friend of foe (Ch. 12 Todd 2000, Blythe et al. 1996).
