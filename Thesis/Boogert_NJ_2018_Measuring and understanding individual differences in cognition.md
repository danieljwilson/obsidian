# Notes
## Summary
**Animals + Information**
1. Learn
2. Remember
3. Integrate

This is a process aimed at facilitating behavior that maximizes our chances of passing on our genetic material (i.e. survival + reproduction)

**Main Idea**
research in animal cognition often ignores [[individual differences]]

**Quantifying Individual Differences in cognitive performance**

1. ==NOISE==
Variation in performance is also affected by non-cognitive factors such as:
- hunger
- motivation
- breeding status
- environmental conditions

2. ==REPEATABILITY==
Repeated testing can help address confounds

3. ==TEST VALIDITY==
True [[measure validity|]] is hard. Difficult to develop multiple measures that get at the same [[construct]].

4. ==DOMAIN GENERALITY VS MODULARITY==
Positive correlations between wide range of measures...this is why we think that [[general intelligence]] is a "thing".

**Recommendations**
1. Multiple tests to assess convergent validity of the test
2. Multiple internal and external states
3. Multiple traits
4. Multiple fitness proxies
