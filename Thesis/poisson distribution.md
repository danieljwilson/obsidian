[[probability]]

# Notes

**Poisson process** is a way to model discrete events where the average time between event occurrences is known but the exact time of some event is not known. 

**The Poisson process dictates the following points:**
1. The probability of some event occurring is independent from all other events.
2. The average rate of events within a given time period is constant.
3. Two events cannot occur at the same moment. E.g. an ion channel can either be in an open or closed state, but not both simultaneously.

- $\lambda$ is **both** the **mean** and the **variance** of the distribution
- bigger $\lambda$ = more symmetric distribution
