# Notes
Extent to which scores on a measure correlate with other variables (criteria) that one would expect them to correlate with.

- When the criterion is measured at teh same time as the [[construct]] [[criterion validity]] is referred to more specifically as [[concurrent validity]].
- When the criterion is measured at some point in the future (after the [[construct]] has been measured), it is referred to as [[predictive validity]].
- Criteria can also be ==other measures of the same [[construct]]!==
	- This is known as [[convergent validity]]

**Example**
- peopleâ€™s scores on a new measure of test anxiety should be negatively correlated with their performance on an important school exam
