# Gap(s)
>...how to reduce the “dimensionality” of all the different behavioral factors we perceive, to distill them to a smaller, more general set (Colin Camerer)

---
What are our measures capturing?
Should we think of it in terms of the levels that Stanovich illustrates in his 2008 paper ([[Stanovich_KE_2008_On the Relative Independence of Thinking Biases and Cognitive Ability]])? 

**Mindware**
- cognitive capacity

**Detection**
- contextual sensitivity

**Sustained inhibition**
- self-control/willpower

Many of the biases seem to be statistical or logical errors.

## Systems Theory
[[systems theory|Systems Theory]] could be an interesting framing.
- Inputs -> Outputs
	- Outputs are either positive or negative. Like with a steam engine could have a model of individual "efficiency". How much of your time/energy/behavior is progressing you toward your goals/[[second-order preference]]?

## Intervention Ideas
> Creating an environment where one may not need to practice effortful impulse inhibition (Fujita, 2011), but rather avoiding situations where that self-control will be tested is highly beneficial. This type of decision making allows for distal goals to be in focus, rather than more immediate goals.
