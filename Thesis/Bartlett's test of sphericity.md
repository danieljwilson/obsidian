[[Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test]]

[[factor analysis adequacy test]]

# Notes
Checks whether or not the observed variables intercorrelate at all using the observed **correlation matrix** against the **identity matrix**.

- If the test found statistically ==insignificant==, **you should not** employ a factor analysis (since you need relationships between the variables)
