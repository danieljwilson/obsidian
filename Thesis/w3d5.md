# Deep Learning 2
- Low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data
- There can be **intrinsic** low dimensional data in a high dimensional system
	- neuroscience data is inherently high dimensional
- One low dimensional representation is created using [[principal component analysis]]
- Autoencoders = nerual network
# Takeaways
- [[autoencoder]] is a means of [[dimensionality reduction]], but also dimensionality re-expansion...
