# Notes
People's self-instructions to achieve desired outcomes

- intentions predict behavior, according to numerous correlational studies
>Sheeran (2002) meta-analyzed 10 previous meta-analysis (422 studies in total) and found a ‘large’ sample-weighted average correlation between intentions measured at one time-point and measures of behavior taken at a subsequent time-point (r+   = 0.53). Moreover, intention offers superior prediction of behavior in correlational tests compared to other cognitions including (explicit and implicit) attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, and perceptions of risk and severity (e.g., McEachan et al., 2011; Sheeran, Harris, & Epton, 2014; Sheeran et al., in press) as well as personality factors (e.g., Chiaburu et al., 2011; Poropat, 2009; Rhodes & Smith, 2006)
- suggests that forming an intention to change ([[goal intentions]]) is vital if people are to initiate new behaviors or to alter courses of action that are no longer seen as desirable
