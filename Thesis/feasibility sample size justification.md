# Notes
The **goal** in research is to provide an answer that is as informative as possible but this has to be balanced against resource limitations (i.e. time/money)!

The **question** is then, *where* is this balance? 

This is a hard question because it requires us to calculate the value of the information we are collecting, in other words a [[utility function]] for scientific research.

In economics there is a analogous concept that is dubbed [[value of information]]

Feasibility always at least a second order determinant of sample size, however a [[feasibility sample size justification]] puts it at the center of the [[sample size]] justification.

In this situation we should evaluate whether the feasibility limitations make data collection **uninformative**...could think of this in terms of [[smallest effect size of interest]].
