# Bayesian Statistics
General Motivation: [[normative models|Normative models]]

Foundations: 
1. [[variable|Variables]]
2. [[probability|Probability]]
3. [[inference|Inference]]

**Computational level** of analysis

**Bayesian decision theory**
- normative

- Cannot answer **HOW** (mechanism) questions
	- Has no theory of computation
	- Need linking hypothesis


**As a model for brain computation:**
- **Task** (computational): Bayes is the best way to solve things
- **Behavior** (representation/algorithm): hypothesis that Bayes describes perception
- **Brain** (implementation constraint): must implement behavior


# Take Aways
- Brain is **estimating** the world (probabilistic process)
	- This means there is **uncertainty**
- There is fundamental stochasticity in the world
- Bayesian models are **WHY** models
- Simplification comes from eliminating dependencies
- **Prior** comes from evolution/development/learning
- Powerful fitting tool for models
- Bayesian **behavior** is NOT the same as a Bayesian **brain**
