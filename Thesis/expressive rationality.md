# Notes
The attempt to articulate and explore values rather than trying to fulfill them.

- referred to as [[symbolic utility]] by Nozick (1993).
- can help us to maintain/reinforce our [[self-image]]
- also sends signals to other actors
- I think that [[virtue signalling]] falls under this umbrella (at least the explanation for it)
