# Notes
## Summary
**Starting Point**: All animals ==learn==, ==remember== and ==integrate== **information** in order to reach **decisions** and **behave** appropriately

**Three** traditional forms of the study of [[animal cognition]]:
1. **Model species** used to investigate the mechanisms underpinning specific cognitive processes
2. **Comparative approach** tests species or populations with the same, or purportedly similar, tasks to understand when in evolutionary history particular cognitive processes may have emerged and what ecological or social conditions may facilitate these processes
3. Abilities of particular, often highly enculturated, ‘**genius**’ individuals are explored in great detail in order to establish the presence of, or limits to, particular cognitive capacities 

- individual variation in cognitive performance may be confounded by **non-cognitive factors** (e.g. hunger, motivation, stress, environmental conditions)
- ==individual consistency== as measured via repeated testing is an important method of addressing confounds.
	- need to make sure we are getting at **traits** and not **states**
	- repeated testing also allows to differentiate between ==among== and ==within== **individual variation**.
	- This isn't done a lot, and there can be issues of confounds with learning if you don't offer novel tasks trying to get at the same cognitive trait

[[content validity|Test Validity]]: a concept that comes into play when we try to confirm that different tests are evaluating the same cognitive trait.

## Thoughts
I think that idea of reducing **state influence** on **trait characteristic** is very compelling.
