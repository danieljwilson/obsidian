# Notes
A concept I define as the gap between one's self-efficacy ideas, i.e. how they view their own ability to achieve goals and one's actual efficacy. 

A mismatch between one's goals and abilities. In this case abilities could refer to:
- crystallized and fluid intelligence
- work ethic
- strategic abilities

In medicine they have something called the "[[efficacy–effectiveness gap]]"...perhaps just apply this to human endeavors/planning?
