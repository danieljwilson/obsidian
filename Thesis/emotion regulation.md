[[emotion]]
[[hedonic emotion regulation]]
[[flexible emotion regulation]]
[[cognitive reappraisal]]
[[expressive suppression]]

# Notes
Aimed at reducing, strengthening, or maintaining the experience of either positive or negative emotions depending on the current needs or goals of an individual.

Five families related to the dynamics of the emotional process in which regulation may occur (from Gross):
1. situation selection
2. situation modification
3. attention deployment
4. cognitive change
5. response modulation

**1-4**: antecedent focused
**5**: response focused

**Two main strategies** (proposed by Gross):
1. [[cognitive reappraisal]] (antecedent focused strategy)
2. [[expressive suppression]] (response-focused strategy)

- emotions do not need to be regulated or modified all the time but only when they interfere with desired behaviors or goals
