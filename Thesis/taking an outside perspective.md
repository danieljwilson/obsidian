# Notes
Idea from [[Daniel Kahneman]] to help avoid some of our [[cognitive biases]].

- “Identify an appropriate reference class”
	- Look for a general category to put your task in. This could be grocery shopping, home remodeling, or a professional project.
- Obtain statistics for this reference class”
	- Try to find a suitable [[base rates|base rate]]. Look for statistics on how long it takes to complete the type of task on average.
- “Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction”
	- If there are certain concrete things that you think are worth changing your predictions for, use your judgment to make prediction adjustments.
