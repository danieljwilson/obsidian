# Notes
Refers to our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing positive events and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing negative events.

- instills feelings of control
- may have [[evolutionarily adaptive]] functions
	-  optimistic bias towards ones outcome results in more aggression and dominance in conflict (Heifetz & Spiegel, 2000).
- Tali Sharot believed that the optimism bias was “one of the core causes of the financial downfall in 2008”
- can possibly be mitigated by [[taking an outside perspective]] and a post mortem approach (Kahneman, 2013).

**Personal thoughts**
Isn't this a subset of some more basic form of inaccurate analysis? Which could be pertaining to:
- your environment
- your situation
- your abilities

Downstream effects on many things, such as:
- [[planning fallacy]]
- [[self-efficacy]]
