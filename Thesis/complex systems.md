[[systems theory]]
[[nonlinear systems]]

# Notes
Class of system.

- Consists of [[elements]] and [[relations]].
- These can be [[ordered]] or [[unordered]].
- When [[elements]] work together a higher level of organization can emerge. This can be recursive (i.e. hierarchical structure)
- This interdependence creates [[nonlinearity]]
- [[feedback loops]] mean [[nonlinear systems]] may grow or decay exponentially
- periods of rapid change are called [[phase transitions]]
- [[sensitivity to initial conditions]]
	- central idea in [[chaos theory]]
- [[connectivity]] is of key importance as the same elements connected in different ways can lead to different properties
	- at a certain level of [[connectivity]] the system can be considered a [[network]], and of key interest is how "things" ==flow== in this network.
- space ([[linear systems]]) -> [[topology]] ([[nonlinear systems]])
- no top-down centralized mechanism for coordinating the whole system
	- patterns of organization emerge from the bottom-up
- elements in [[complex systems]] subject to selection pressures
