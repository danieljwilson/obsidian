# Notes
## Summary
Much of what people do is predicated on forecasts of the future.
Forecasting is difficult due to [[uncertainty]].

Authors don't agree with the idea that **people manage [[uncertainty]] as if there were reducing it to [[risk|risks]]**.

Types of [[uncertainty]] include:
1. [[environmental uncertainty]]
2. [[strategic uncertainty]]

The [[adaptive toolbox]] consists of tools that allow us to make predictions, inferences and decisions in this world of [[uncertainty]].

**Cognitive tools** for dealing with [[uncertainty]] include:
1. Simple [[heuristics]]
2. [[information search|Information search]]
3. [[collective intelligence|Collective intelligence]]

Cognitive tools are affected by the abilities of the mind in question - for example one's knowledge, [[working memory]] capacity, [[cognitive control]].

**Choosing** among cognitive tools also is another source of [[uncertainty]].

The ambitious goal:
>we  must  eventually  also  construct  theories  of  the  systemâ€™s  processes as well as theories of the mechanisms underlying the emergence of classes of environmental structures. 


Social (competitive) environments seen as more complex than physical environments (Hertwig,  Hoffrage,  &  the  ABC  Research  Group,  2013.

- [[information search|Search]] and [[choice]] are closely linked.
- authors assert that human rationality should not be reduced to  performance in tasks were [[information search|search]] and [[uncertainty]] have largely been removed (no longer [[ecological validity|ecologically valid]]).
- [[competition]] adds complexity to the [[exploitation-exploration trade-off]]
- little is known about how [[competition]] affects [[information search]] in [[choice]]
- adaptive use of a [[heuristics|heuristic]] requires experience and knowledge ([[crystallized intelligence]])

## Thoughts
- To me seems like a problem that there isn't really a classification of [[environment structure]] at this point. This is a required assumption in order that we don't find ourselves in another case of untenable complexity. I think that you would do well to build off of this. Since it is the foundation upon which the idea of generalized heuristics rests.
