# Notes
Occurs when people have difficulty evaluating conclusions  that  conflict  with  what  they  think  they  know  about the world (i.e. prior beliefs).

**...or more precisely perhaps:**

The tendency to judge the strength of arguments based on the ==plausibility of their conclusion== rather than how strongly they support that conclusion

- often assessed with syllogistic reasoning tasks in which  the  believability  of  the  conclusion  conflicts  with  logical validity.
- an interaction between logical validity and the believability of the conclusion
