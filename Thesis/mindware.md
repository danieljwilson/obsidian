# Notes
The rules, knowledge, and thinking styles that decision makers bring to a problem.

Referred to as [[cognitive capital]] by [[Colin F. Camerer]]

[[Keith E. Stanovich]] on [[mindware]]:
> tools to think scientifically and the propensity to do so; the tendency to think logically; and knowledge of some special rules of formal reasoning and good argumentation

## Thoughts
Is [[intelligence]] not part of this?

I think of it as a combination of:
- [[intelligence]] (fluid and crystallized)
- mental models (gained by applying intelligence to experience)

In [[Keith E. Stanovich]] definition he refers to the ==propensity to do so== referring to applying one's cognitive tools to a decision/behavior. This to me seems outside of [[mindware]]. I think of it as:
1. **ability** (do you have the correct tool for the job)
2. **detection** (did you figure out that the job requires this tool)
3. **implementation** (did you use the tool to complete the job)
