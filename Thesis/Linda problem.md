# Notes
A classic [[conjunction bias]] test based on the following text:

>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very  bright.  She  majored  in  philosophy.  As  a  student,  she  was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice,and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

Participants then use a 6-point scale 
- 1 extremely improbable
- 2 very improbable
- 3 somewhat probable
- 4 moderately probable 
- 5 very probable
- 6 extremely probable)

to indicate the relative probability of three statements that described Linda. 

The first two statements were identical for the two groups of participants as follows: 
1) It is ______ that Linda is a teacher in an  elementary  school
2) It  is  ______  that  Linda  works  in  a bookstore and takes Yoga classes. 

Each group (in a [[between-subjects design]]) then reads one of two statements that differed in whether they did or did not contain a conjunction of two descriptions. 

Participants getting Form A read the following: 
3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller. 

Participants getting Form B read the following:
3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

**Results**
Basically it is **logically** more likely that Linda *is a teller* than a *bank teller and active in the feminist movement* but people tend to be biased toward the latter.
