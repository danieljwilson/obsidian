# Notes
## Summary

**Gap**
>people who found evidence that that processing follows a "system 1 -> system 2" pattern, might just be observing sequential patterns of attention

* time pressure increases the "framing" effect (at least for risky monetary choices)
* **idea**: [[ddm]], for example, dominated early by system 1, which in turn is sensitive to the framing effect
* Ian postulates that this rests on two (uncertain) assumption:
	* **ONE**: all information is processed simultaneously
	* **TWO**: does not account for a possible change in strategy by the decision maker 


## Thoughts
* What were average RTs in no time pressure?
>To further ensure that our participants felt time pressure, they were informed that failing to respond by the deadline meant they would not earn any points on that trial.
* In my opinion this would just lead me to do nothing if it was a likely loss...same as rejecting
* line 170 typo
* is the loss M the same in both conditions? (261-2)

>time constraint was driven entirely by participants choosing the sure option more frequently when time was limited for gain-framed trials, t(44) = 8.83, p < .001, whereas there was no effect of time on choices for the loss-framed trials, t(44) = -0.02, p = .98. 
* Doesn't this suggest a heuristic in effect?
	* Addresses on line 397

>when participants looked at both options under time constraints, they tended to choose the opposite of whatever option they fixated first, a result that we explore below.

Optimal behavior different in two conditions...
TC
Participants have a sense of the "mean" earning by trial. If the first option is better than that, under time pressure, then select. Otherwise go to he other option.
