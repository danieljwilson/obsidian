# Notes
$$ AIC = 2K - 2 log(L)$$

where K is the number of parameters in your model and L is the likelihood that the model could have produced the output data. 

---

- AIC estimates how much information would be lost if the model predictions were used instead of the true data (the relative information value of the model)
