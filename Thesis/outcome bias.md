# Notes

**Example**
- from Baron and Hershey (1988)

Participants receiving Form A (this is in a [[between-subjects design]]) read the positive outcome version involving a 55-year-old man who had a heart condition and whose operation succeeded.  Participants  evaluated  the  physician’s  decision  to  go ahead with the operation.

- 1 incorrect, a very bad decision
- 2 incorrect, all things considered
- 3 incorrect, but not unreasonable
- 4 the decision and its opposite are equally good
- 5 correct, but the opposite would be reasonable too
- 6 correct, all things considered
- 7 clearly correct, an excellent decision).

Participants receiving Form B (negative outcome) evaluated a medical  decision  that  was  designed  to  be  objectively  better  than the first: 2% chance of death rather than 8%; 10-year increase in life  expectancy  versus  5-year  increase,  etc.  However,  it  had  an unfortunate negative outcome— death of the patient.
