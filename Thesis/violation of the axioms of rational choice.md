# Notes
Humans often violate the [[axioms of rational choice]]...

- one problem with [[axioms of rational choice]] is that they assume choices are not affected by [[context]]/[[decision environment]]
- It can be the case that lower level animals exhibit greater [[instrumental rationality]] than humans, as outlined in [[Stanovitch_KE_2013_Why humans are (sometimes) less rational than other animals]]
