# Notes
## Summary
**Context**: Single neurons in visual cortex provide unreliable measurements of visual features due to their high trial-to-trial variability.  

**Gap**: It is not known if this “noise” extends its effects over large neural populations to impair the global encoding of stimuli. 

**Experiment**: We recorded simultaneously from∼20,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and found that the neural populations had discrimination thresholds of∼0.34◦in an orientation decoding task.  These thresholds were nearly 100 times smaller than those reported behaviorally in mice.

**Takeaway**:  Limits of sensory perception in mice are not set by neural noise in sensory cortex, but by the limitations of downstream decoders.
