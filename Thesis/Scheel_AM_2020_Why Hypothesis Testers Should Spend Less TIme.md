# Notes
## Summary
Problem is a weakness in the [[derivation chain]].
We need to have the correct/valid/accurate **inputs** to make our hypothesis test meaningful.

The **inputs** include:
1. concepts
2. [[measures]]
3. [[casual relationships]]
4. [[boundary conditions]]
5. [[auxiliary assumptions]]

Currently these inputs are often based on rules of thumbs and received wisdom. Needs to be more principled.

These inputs are used in the last step of the [[hypothetico-deductive method]] [[derivation chain]]:
6. statistical predictions
