# Notes
## Summary
**The neuroecon agenda** as stated by Camerer, Loewenstein, &Prelec in 2004:
> *to bring neuroscience techniques and knowledge to bear on economic analysis*

**The hope:**
>  functional  magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) technique would allow researchers to identify which regions of the human brain are involved in different types of decisions and that activity in those regions would definitively reveal peopleâ€™s thoughts
- idea that activity in different brain regions could be used to arbitrate between competing behavioral models

**Problems**, however...
- Much research inferred thought processes from brain activity - even though one brain region could be recruited by **many** different tasks...this is known as the problem of [[reverse inference]]
- [["as if" models]]

**Changes**:
- A change in focus from [[correlation]] (regressions) to [[out-of-sample prediction]]
- Use of [[multivariate pattern analysis]]
- Use of brain stimulation methods

#### Value and Learning
- [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] (vmPFC) and [[striatum]] (or the encompassing [[basal ganglia]] or subregions: [[caudate]], [[putamen]], and [[nucleus accumbens]]) present in almost all neuroecon studies. Seem to be involved in learning/story/retrieving/updating **[[value|values]]**.
- Bayesian updating vs [[reinforcement learning]]...dopamine  neurons  in the macaque  brain  reflect  properties  of  reinforcement  learning (Schultz,  Dayan,  and  Montague, 1997).
- Human  fMRI  research  has  found  correlations  between  the  behaviorally  estimated  [[prediction error|prediction errors]]  and  brain  activity  in  the  ventral [[striatum]].
- studies  corroborate  the  idea  that  the  brain  has  two  distinct  learning systems, one being habitual (or reinforcement-based, or [[model-free]]) and the other one being goal-directed  (or [[model-based]]).
- [[sequential sampling models]] based on idea of evidence accumulation
- normalization of firing rates to match the range of values in the environment )[[divisive normalization]]

#### Application
- some success predicting choice based on neural activity
- down the road perhaps possible to predict behavioral characteristics of entire societies/communities based on their observable genetic and environmental  features

## Thoughts
What are the real takeaways? 
- It seems that the [[reinforcement learning]] support based on the dopamine experiment is the most compelling?
- The support for [[sequential sampling models]] does not seem ironclad, but plausible.
- The valuation "regions" in the brain seem fairly well localized but what do we get from that?
- [[divisive normalization]] is interesting but is that really [[neuroeconomics]]?
