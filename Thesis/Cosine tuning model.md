# Notes
- Refers to spatial response profile of neurons
	- Can be approximated by cosine function
- Equation:
>$$\frac{f(s) - f_0)}{f_{max}} = cos(s-s_p)$$
- Basically you normalize the firing rate (left side of the equation)
	- actual firing rate - base firing rate / maximum firing rate
- This looks like a cosine curve with a peak in the movement direction the neuron is most sensitive to
