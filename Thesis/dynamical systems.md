[[linear dynamical system]]

# Notes
- Mathematics of things that **change in time**
- From evolution of species to conformational changes of small molecules/proteins
- dynamics are an **update rule**
	- where will we be one "time step" later ($\Delta t$)?

**Basic Equation** for [[linear dynamical system]]:
$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$$

- Where $x$ is the state **variable**
- A common notational short-hand is to write $\dot{x}$ for $\frac{dx}{dt}$. The dot means "the derivative with respect to time". This can be written as:
$$\dot{x} = a x$$ 
where $a$ is a scalar.
