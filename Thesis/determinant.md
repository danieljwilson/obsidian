# Notes
 - determinant refers to **AREA**
 ![[determinant 1.png]]
 - The determinant is ZERO if it is a line or point...(because area becomes zero)
	 - This lets you know if a transformation squishes things into a smaller dimension
 - Determinant can be **negative**
	 - If they invert the orientation of space
	 - Absolute value still tells you of factor by which area has been scaled
 - In 3D it is connected to **volumes** instead of areas
	 - Think of 1x1x1 cube
 - If the determinant of a transformation is 0, then **there is no inverse**!
	 - You are losing information when you collapse dimensions. You can't transform a line into a plane...
 - [[rank|Rank]] refers to the number of dimensions in the output of a transformation
	 - Also can be said to be the number of dimensions in column space
