# Notes
If you **prefer** $x$ when presented $x$ and $y$ you should **still prefer $x$ over** $y$ when presented with the options $x$ $y$ and $z$.
- Also known as [[property alpha]]
- Often violated

**Example violation**
>consider a guest at a party faced with a bowl with one apple in it. The individual leaves the apple—thus choosing nothing (x) over an apple (y). A few minutes later, the host puts a pear (z) in the bowl. Shortly thereafter, the guest takes the apple. Seemingly, the guest has just done what the diner did in the previous example. The guest has chosen x when presented with x and y, but has chosen y when presented with x, y, and z. Has the independence of irrelevant alternatives been violated? Most will think not. Choice y in the second situation is not the same as choice y in the first—so the equivalency required for a violation of the principle seems not to hold. While choice y in the second situation is simply ‘‘taking an apple’’, choice y in the first is contextualised and probably construed as ‘‘taking the last apple in the bowl when I am in public’’ with all of its associated negative utility inspired by considerations of politeness.
