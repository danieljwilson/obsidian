# Notes
Judgments relying on what comes first

Estimates are made starting from anchor value which is then adjusted in a deliberate fashion, step by step until the satisfactory answer is reached. 

The number of steps people take is usually insufficient since they stop adjusting as soon as they reach **the first answer that seems acceptable**. 

Anchoring is seen as a consequence of this prematurely ended serial process.
