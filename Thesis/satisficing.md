# Notes
A method for making a choice from a set of alternatives  encountered  sequentially  when  one  does  not know much about the possibilities in advance.

A shortcut that sets an "aspiration level" and then stops searching for alternatives as soon as an option exceeds this threshold (Simon 1956b;1990).
