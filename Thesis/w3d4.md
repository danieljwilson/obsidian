# Deep Learning
- Convolution operation performs a summary of each region
	- Uses a filter (like a flashlight)
	- sliding motion of filter over "image" = convolution
	- illuminated region = receptive field
- Can stack convolutional layers
- Later layers in network have larger receptive field
	- can represent more complex visual patterns
