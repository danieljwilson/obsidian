# Notes
An automatic and routine behaviour repeated as it is easy, comfortable or rewarding.

**Three keys**
1. formation requires **repetition**
2. once formed, the habit directs behavior **automatically**
3. **context-dependent** (situational cues activate the habit impulse)

- Habitual behaviors are repetitive, but not all repetitive behaviors are habitual (e.g. taking the garbage out each week).
