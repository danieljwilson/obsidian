# Notes
The collection of specialized cognitive mechanisms that evolution has built into the human mind for specific domains of [[inference]] and reasoning, including [[fast and frugal heuristics]] (see also Bettman 1979; Cosmides & Tooby 1992; Payne et al. 1993).

- contains psychological adaptations
- higher order cognitive processes (such as [[fast and frugal heuristics]]) rely on lower-order processes such as [[cue perception]] and [[memory]]
- [[heuristics]] can be recombined/nested/used as building blocks
