# Notes
The line about which the [[parabola]] is symmetric

For a [[parabola]] with equation $y = ax^2 + bx +c$, the [[axis of symmetry]] is the line $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$
Therefore the $x$-coordinate of the [[vertex]] is $-\frac{b}{2a}$.

For a [[parabola]] with equation $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$, the [[axis of symmetry]] is the line $x = h$, and the [[vertex]] is the point $(h,k)$.
