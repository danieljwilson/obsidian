# Notes
Operationalization of [[utility theory]].

Includes:
- the [[independance of irrelevant alternatives axiom]]
- [[transitivity axiom]]
- [[independence axiom]]
- [[reduction of compound lotteries axiom]]
- [[descriptive and procedural invariance axiom]]

Often violated as in work of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]].

[[Keith E. Stanovich]] suggests this is partly because of the fact that they ignore [[context effects]] ([[Stanovitch_KE_2013_Why humans are (sometimes) less rational than other animals]]).
