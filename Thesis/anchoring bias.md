# Notes
The systematic influence of initially presented numerical values on subsequent judgments of uncertain quantities, even when presented numbers are obviously arbitrary and therefore unambiguously irrelevant.

The effect is that we use the first piece of information almost as a prior of sorts, and then bias our judgments toward that prior/baseline/anchor.

- standard two-step paradigm of anchoring introduced by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 1974.
- moderate anchors seem to have stronger effects
- stronger effect for anchors set above than below
- based on [[anchoring and adjustment heuristic]]
