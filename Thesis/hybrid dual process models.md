# Notes
This is fairly new, so not everyone agrees on the "hybrid" model, but most contain the following characteristics:

1. when  people  face  conflict  reasoning  tasks,  they  quickly generate **several intuitive responses** based on heuristics as well as the logical structure of  the  problem
2. **differences  in  the  relative  strength**  of  these  intuitive outputs  determine  whether people will detect the conflict and subsequently engage in analytic [[system 2]] processing
