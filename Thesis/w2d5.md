# Reinforcement Learning
- Driven to minimize prediction errors
- Method to determine actions for agent ([[policy]])
- $\alpha$: **Learning rate**
- $\pi$: **Policy**
	- The strategy for choosing actions based on our expectations
	- [[greedy policy|Greedy policy]]:
		- $\begin{align}a_{t} = \text{argmax}_{a} \; q_{t} (a)\end{align}$
	- $\gamma$: **Discount factor**
		- defines an agents [[delay discounting]] style

**Agent-Environment interface**

**[[dopamine|Dopamine]]	and [[classical conditioning]]**
![[dopamine_classical_conditioning.png]]

- Problem of dynamic programming -> curse of dimensionality
- on-policy vs. off-policy
- policy iteration -> policy optimization
# Takeaways
- still not clear on difference between [[model-free]] and [[model-based]]
