# Notes
An [[algorithms|algorithm]] that measures the transitive influence or [[connectivity]] of [[nodes]].

It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one nodeâ€™s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbours or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks

- PageRank is a variant of [[eigenvector centrality]].
