# Network Causality
- [[correlation]] or [[association]] vs. [[causality]]
- If you know about variables associated with your variable with interest you can make better predictions...but this doesn't answer the questions of causality!

**We cannot learn causality from passive observations**

- association â‰  causation, but **no association without causation!**
- we are interested in the relationship between a [[treatment variable]] to an [[outcome variable]]
- Problem: We only get to observe one outcome
	- A missing data problem
	- Randomization means that these missing values are **missing at random** (not systematically)
- Randomization can go wrong
	- Sampling bias
		- One solution = matching (include similar people in both [[treatment group]] and [[control group]])
	- People dropping out of study
		- They may not drop out randomly...therefore biasing sample again
	- If randomization is not possible?
		- [[instrumental variable|Instrumental variables]]
