# Notes
A good [[measures|measure]] must demonstrate both [[measure validity]] and [[measure reliability]].

- Common mistake is to assume that different measures that are designed to access the same [[construct]] are equivalent.
	- e.g., using [[stated preference|stated preferences]] versus [[behavioural task|behavioural tasks]] to measure risk-preference (Frey et al.,2017)
