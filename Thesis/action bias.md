# Notes
Tendency to favor action over inaction.
- often this is beneficial but it can become a default response, even without solid rationale to support it.
- Pushes us to act in order to feel good.
- people have an impulse to act in order to gain a sense of control over a situation
- often the result is that we act improperly/sub-optimally, or at least to act before the right time comes
- leads to develop solutions when we have not yet defined the problem well
- desire to be "active", or to seem active
- suggested that this tendency is hard-wired from our [[hunter-gatherers]] days, when it was [[adaptive behavior]]
- can be connected to [[social norms]]
- may be more likely among [[overconfident]] individuals.
