# Notes
What information to USE when making decision

How MUCH to learn from feedback. 
- ==Question of learning rate?==
- Should be based on uncertainty in environment

Reversal learning experiment

Expected uncertainty
- investing in an ETF

Volatility 
- should lead to substantial update of value

Volatility - if the reversal learning happened every trial or 2 trials then probably do just as well with NO learning. Need some stability to have learnable volatility
