# Notes
Ability to monitor one's **own** and **others**' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions.

- emerged as a major psychological construct in the early 1990s
- conceptualized as a set of abilities largely analogous to [[general intelligence]]

Two popular methods of classifying EI measures:
1. distinction between **trait** and **ability** (Petrides and Furnham, 2000)
2. The three EI “streams” (as proposed by Ashkanasy and Daus, 2005)

**Ability EI based measures** 
- give a good indication of individuals' ability to understand emotions and how they work.
- since they are tests of maximal ability, they **do not** tend to predict typical behavior as well as trait based measures
- valid, albeit weak, predictors of a range of outcomes including work related attitudes such as job satisfaction (Miao et al., 2017), and job performance (O'Boyle et al., 2011)
	
**Trait EI based measures**
- utilize self-report items to measure overall EI and its sub dimensions
- individuals high in various measures of trait EI have been found to have high levels of **self-efficacy** regarding emotion-related behaviors and tend to be competent at managing and **regulating emotions** in themselves and others
- tend to provide a good prediction of actual behaviors in a range of situations (Petrides and Furnham, 2000)
- recent meta-analyses have linked trait EI to a range of work attitudes such as job satisfaction and organization commitment (Miao et al., 2017)
- research tends to show that trait EI is a good predictor of effective coping styles in response to life stressors (e.g.,Austin et al., 2010)
