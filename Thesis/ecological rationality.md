# Notes
Interaction between cognition and the environment.
**or**
Adaptive behavior resulting from the fit between the mind's mechanisms and the structure of the environment in which it operates.

A measure of the fit between a [[heuristics|heuristic]] - or any decision- making tool - and an environment. 

- [[environment structure]] can be exploited by decision making tools/strategies such as [[heuristics]]
- By understanding the [[ecological rationality]] of a [[heuristics|heuristic]], we can predict when it fails and succeeds (Gigerenzer 2008)
