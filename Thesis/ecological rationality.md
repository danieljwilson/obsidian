# Notes
Interaction between cognition and the environment.
**or**
Adaptive behavior resulting from the fit between the mind's mechanisms and the structure of the environment in which it operates.

- By understanding the [[ecological rationality]] of a [[heuristics|heuristic]], we can predict when it fails and succeeds (Gigerenzer 2008)
