# Notes
Idea that measures should provide consistent values across time.

- [[test-retest correlation]] > .8 is generally considered to suggest good measure reliability.

> Assessing test-retest reliability requires using the measure on a group of people at one time, using it again on the same group of people at a later time, and then looking at test-retest correlation between the two sets of scores.
