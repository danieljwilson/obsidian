# Notes
Tendency to opt for situations where we can completely eliminate risk, seeking solace in the figure of 0%, over alternatives that may actually offer greater risk reduction.

- often public pressure to strive for zero risk
	- e.g. terrorism, gun violence
- this can lead to inefficient use of resources and sub-optimal reduction of **global risk**
