# Notes
## Summary
Hard to be rational with our limitations on knowledge and time.

Exploration of fast and frugal [[heuristics]], which fall within the context of [[bounded rationality]].

The [[adaptive toolbox]] is filled with fast and frugal [[heuristics]] that we can select from based on a given situation/environment.

![[visions_of_rationality.png]]

Unbounded rationality ignores the fact that real choices involve [[limited information search]]. 

[[optimization under constraints|Optimization under constraints]] often proposed as a solution to the [[bounded rationality]] problem, but this assumes that we can optimize our [[stopping rule]]...which again can require unbounded computational resources/rationality.

The authors also don't really trust [[satisficing]] as they feel that it still lets unrealistic computation slip back in as we need to set our appropriate [[aspiration level]] in the first place, or to calculate how the current optino compares to the [[aspiration level]]...(Simon  1956b). Though they later say that there is overlap in the concepts...i.e. some forms of [[satisficing]] can be fast and frugal

Their version of "fast and frugal" [[heuristics]] has:
1. easily computable stopping rules
2. easily computable decision rules

Examples of [[fast and frugal heuristics]]:
1. [[one reason decision making heuristic|One reason decision making heuristic]]
2. [[ignorance based heuristic|Ignorance based heuristic]]
3. [[elimination heuristic|Elimination heuristic]] for multiple-option choices
4. [[satisficing heuristics|Satisficing heuristics]] strategy used when the alternatives themselves take time to find

The simplicity of heuristics tends to make them better on measures of [[generalization]].
- privilege generality over specificity (don't [[overfitting|overfit]])

We are not trying to satisfy the laws of [[logic]] of [[probability]] with our behavior/choices, but rather to make adaptive inferences in the real world (given limited time and knowledge)!

- need to evaluate [[heuristics]] based on the external world rather than [[internal consistency]]
- the goal is not coherence
- [[correspondence criteria]] = measures that relate [[decision making]] strategies to the external world (Hammond1996)

**But do people actually use these [[fast and frugal heuristics]]?**

We don't know much about this - but can look at [[outcome measures]] to see if they more closely match an optimal algorithm or a [[heuristics|heuristic]] strategy. [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and [[Peter M. Todd]] found some evidence for the [[recognition heuristic]] in an experiment predicting city size.

- however often [[outcome measures]] are insufficient as both simple and complex heuristics lead to similar levels of performance - the [[flat maximum problem]]
- in this case we can consider [[process measures]].

The authors also assert that simple [[heuristics]] can be used in social settings.

[[correspondence criteria]] such as consistency, speed, frugality > [[coherence criteria]] such as consistency, [[transitivity]] and [[additivity]] of probabilities.

Still don't really know how we actually select a particular [[heuristics|heurisitic]] in a particular situation...

## Thoughts
- Is the only limitation actually time? If we had infinite time to make any decision would we not be able to figure out the correct choice?
- Gets a bit circular because the best choice is now often predicated on time...i.e. maybe we choose for a worse meal but it is better because we can get it before starving...
