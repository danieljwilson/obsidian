# Notes
## Summary
Hard to be rational with our limitations on knowledge and time.

Exploration of fast and frugal [[heuristics]], which fall within the context of [[bounded rationality]].

The [[adaptive toolbox]] is filled with fast and frugal [[heuristics]] that we can select from based on a given situation/environment.

Unbounded rationality ignores the fact that real choices involve [[limited information search]]. 

[[optimization under constraints|Optimization under constraints]] often proposed as a solution to the [[bounded rationality]] problem, but this assumes that we can optimize our [[stopping rule]]...which again can require unbounded computational resources/rationality.

The authors also don't really trust [[satisficing]] as they feel that it still lets unrealistic computation slip back in as we need to set our appropriate [[aspiration level]] in the first place, or to calculate how the current optino compares to the [[aspiration level]]...(Simon  1956b). Though they later say that there is overlap in the concepts...i.e. some forms of [[satisficing]] can be fast and frugal

Their version of "fast and frugal" [[heuristics]] has:
1. easily computable stopping rules
2. easily computable decision rules

Examples of [[fast and frugal heuristics]]:
1. [[one reason decision making heuristic|One reason decision making heuristic]]
2. [[ignorance based heuristic|Ignorance based heuristic]]
3. [[one reason decision making heuristic]]

## Thoughts
- Is the only limitation actually time? If we had infinite time to make any decision would we not be able to figure out the correct choice?
- Gets a bit circular because the best choice is now often predicated on time...i.e. maybe we choose for a worse meal but it is better because we can get it before starving...
