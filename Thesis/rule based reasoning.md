[[artificial intelligence]]
[[decision]]
[[strategy selection]]
[[rules-based systems]]
[[heuristics]]

# Notes
Three components (in [[artificial intelligence]]):
1. Rules
2. Data base
3. Interpreter

- One approach to [[internal behavioral intervention]] uses this method, focusing on training people in abstract rules that apply across situations

### Thoughts
Is related to some of the [[thesis intervention]] ideas - simpler to have a rule of thumb than to really analyze a complete set of info/options.

Seems like [[heuristics]] are an example of a [[rules-based systems|rules based system]].
