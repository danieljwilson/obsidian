[[dynamical systems]]


# Notes
	- This is an interactive [[markov model]]
- Present state determines probability of transitions to the next state
- Two state Markov also known as [[telegraph process]]
	- This is a binary [[hidden markov model]]
- [[markov model]]: Dynamical system with restricted dynamics
- Future is independent of the past given the present
