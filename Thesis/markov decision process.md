[[hidden markov model]]
[[dynamical systems]]


# Notes
A description of the environment as a set of states that transition to each other probabilistically (possibly dependent on an agentâ€™s actions), and a set of rewards that may be available in each state.
- Present state determines probability of transitions to the next state
- Future is independent of the past given the present
- This is an interactive [[markov model]]
- Two state Markov also known as [[telegraph process]]
	- This is a binary [[hidden markov model]]
- [[markov model]]: Dynamical system with restricted dynamics

### Thoughts
Is the reward necessary?
