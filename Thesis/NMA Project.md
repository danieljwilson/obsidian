# Notes
Proposed projects of interest:
- Biological learning rules for supervised and unsupervised tasks
- State sequences in population dynamics across cortical areas
- Understanding trained neural networks (RNNs and/or DNNs)
- Communication within brain area
- State-dependence of stim+choice signals
- Impact of circadian rhythms on task performance
- Dimensionality within and between brain areas


# Group B
### Questions
- What is a state?
	- How to categorize beyond moving/non-moving
	- Interesting to think about how to categorize states

Keep in mind:
- Movement has multiple parts: (preparation/movement/feedback)
