# Notes
Meta-analyses by Bartra, McGuire, and Kable (2013) and Clithero and Rangel (2014) suggest that three regions consistently correlate with [[subjective value]]:

1. [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]]
2. [[striatum]]
3. [[posterior cingulate cortex]]

**However**, based on more recent work it seems that the [[posterior cingulate cortex]] correlations with value are likely due to the PCCâ€™s role in processing numerical magnitude rather than subjective value (i.e. responds more to 100 cents than $1, from Kanayet, Opfer, & Cunningham, 2014).
