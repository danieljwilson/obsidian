# Notes
**Definition**
Let  $a$ and $x$ be positive [[real number]]s, with $a$ not equal to $1$.

The number $s$ satisfying $a^s = x$ is the base-$a$ logarithm of $x$
and is denoted by $\log_ax$.

That is:
- $\log_ax = s$ (logarithmic form)

**if and only if** 
- $a^s = x$ (exponential form)

The base-$e$ logarithm, which is $\log_e$, is denoted by $\ln$. It is the [[natural logarithm]].
