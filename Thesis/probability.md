# Notes
Measures occurrence of events
- Subjective: belief that an event occurs (occurred, will occur)
- [[frequentist statistics|Frequentist]]: Frequency of observed event

Two Rules
1. **[[product rule|Product Rule]]**: If two events are independent, the [[probability]] of both is the product of each's probability:

$$p(x, y) = p(x)p(y)$$

2. **[[sum rule|Sum Rule]]**: If two events are mutually exclusive the probability of either is the sum of each's probability:

$$p(x=x_1 or x=x_2) = p(x_1) + p(x_2)$$
