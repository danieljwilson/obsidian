# Notes

- In studies, subject ratings of [[risk]] and [[reward]] are negatively correlated (Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic & Peters, 2006) 
- Finucane et al. (2000) believe this is not [[normative]], as in a natural environment you would expect a positive correlation as humans should eliminate high risk low reward activities, so in a four cells partition of high/low of risk and benefit, the high risk low benefit cell would be underpopulated.

This is conjectured to be due to the fact that judgments  about  the  risks  and  benefits  of  various  activities  and technologies  derive  not  from  separable  knowledge  sources  relevant  to  risk  and  benefit  but  instead  derive  from  a  common source--[[affect]].

**Personal Opinion** 
This seems a bit shaky to me. There are theoretically infinite high risk low reward activities. So in activities we are likely to actually engage in, then I would be surprised if there were not a positive correlation between risk and benefit (in the broad sense...i.e. enjoyment)
