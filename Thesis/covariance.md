# Notes
**Covariance** of $A$ and $B$ is:
$$\mathbb{E}(AB) - \mathbb{E}(A)\mathbb{E}(B)$$

**[[correlation|Correlation]]** and **[[covariance|Covariance]]** both measure the **strength** and **direction** of the linear relationship between two variables. 

The difference is:
- [[correlation|Correlation]] values are **[[standardized]]**!
- [[covariance|Covariance]] values are **not [[standardized]]**!

Divide [[covariance]] values by [[standard deviation]] and you get the [[correlation]] - which is **scaled** to a **range between -1 and 1**.
