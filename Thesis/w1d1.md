# Model Types
## Levels of Analysis
- **WHAT**: Descriptive
	- find an equation that describes the data
		- doesn't say anything about **meaning**
- **HOW**: Mechanistic
	- how does the brain actually make/create the data
		- **mechanistic** level
- **WHY**: Interpretive
	- what is the reason/advantage of the brain being the way it is?
		- which things matter?
		- how to think about [[optimization|optimization]]

## Section 1: What Models
Link: [Steinmetz et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1787-x)

- We used "what" models to discover that the ISI distribution of real neurons is closest to an exponential distribution
- [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JHjjm5b69oOub6XrGdHfsSShaWCuMveL#scrollTo=NGIGUXtV9Y9v)

## Section 2: How Models
- We used "how" models to discover that balanced excitatory and inbhitiory inputs, coupled with a leaky membrane, can give rise to neuronal spiking with exhibiting such an exponential ISI distribution

## Section 3: Why Models
 - We used "why" models to discover that exponential ISI distributions contain the most information when the mean spiking is constrained

# Take aways
- ISI histograms look [[Exponential distribution|exponential]]
- "Leaky integrate-and-fire" neuron model
	- Inhibition and excitation balanced
- [[entropy]]
	- Exponentially distributed spiking maximizes information/bandwidth of system
