# Notes
A [[preference]] for a particular set of [[first-order preference|first-order preferences]].

The [[second-order preference]] can compete with the [[first-order preference]].

- also known as [[strong evaluation]] or [[considered preferences]]
- maintaining a model of an idealized preference structure seems unique to humans

**Example**
"I would prefer to prefer not to smoke".
