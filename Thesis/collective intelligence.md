# Notes
The ability of the group to sometimes outperform individual decision makers when solving cognitive problems.

- [[decision making]] in humans and animals often occurs in groups
- Pooling information, votes, and preferences in order to make group decisions  can  be  a  powerful  way  of  outwitting  both  the  physical  and  the  social environment 
- selection processes can produce biased groups
