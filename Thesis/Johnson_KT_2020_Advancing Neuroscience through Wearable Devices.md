# Notes
## Summary
Focuses on smart watches and [[electrodermal activity]].

Point out that EDA, interestingly can have different readings at the same time when recorded from different body parts.

Their interest seems to be mainly in seizure characterization and detection.

## Thoughts
Not super relevant for my [[thesis]] work.
