# Notes
The  most  important  aspects  of  an agent’s environment are often created by the other agents it interacts with. Thus, predators must make crucial inferences about the behavior of their prey (Ch. 12), males and females must make decisions about others they are interested in mating with (Ch. 13), and parents must figure out how to help their children (Ch. 14). Social rationality is a special form of [[ecological rationality]].
