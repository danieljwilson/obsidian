[[Levels of Analysis]]

# Notes
## Definition
>Models are an **abstraction of reality**
>A model is a **hypothesis**.

- **Question**: What is the right level of abstraction?
	- Keep it as simple as possible, but as detailed as needed [[Occam's Razor]]
- Models **allow** for:
	- **Understanding**
		- You can learn something beyond what you could get with just an experiment alone
	- **Control**
		- A model can suggest interventions (e.g. experimental, clinical)
	- Models **require**
		- Validation (via experimentation)
	- Models are constrained/informed by data
	- [[Levels of Analysis]]

## Uses
- Knowledge synthesis
- Identifying hidden assumption, hypotheses, unknowns
- Mechanistic insight
- Retrieve latent information
- A testbench for medical interventions
- Guidance in designing useful experiments -> Quantitative predictions
- Inspire new [[Technology|technologies]] /application
