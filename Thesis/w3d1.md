# Real Neurons
- [[Hodgkin & Huxley model|Hodgkin and Huxley]] described an [[action potential]]

**Neurons can do many key operations:**
- Summation/integration
- Sequence computation 
- Association
- Memory

- Short term dynamics
	- history of firing has an effect on current firing likelihood
- 


# Takeaways
- signal decay is key
	- exponential
- Information as chemistry
- Computation takes place across scales
- Neurons are morphologically complex
