# Notes

Putting things together may not be the same as the sum of the parts.

- defies [[superposition principles]]
	- [[additivity]]
	- [[homogeneity principal]]

- problems is formulation of non-linear descriptions in mathematical form...

**Example**
- Two sound waves that cancel each other out
