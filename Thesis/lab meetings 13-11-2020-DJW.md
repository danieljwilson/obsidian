# Intro
- **Change from previous work**
	- looking for something that feels more directly aligned with the world
	- measurements I understand...
		- ==ecological validity==
	- ==practical predictive utility==	

**During Talk**
- Early days
- Bring up practical and conceptual questions/concerns
- Ask for clarification...a lot of new material for me so if you don't understand something it is probably not you its me...
- Stop me

- So lets start with this idea of the Gap.
- My first introduction was the NSERC grant writing seminar...
- But there is another gap...
	- saw within myself and also within academia more generally...
	- a lot of ambition + deadlines are largely self-imposed, and so can be self-unimposed, or self-adjusted.


**Theory of planned behavior**
- what is the missing link
- attitude/behavior correspondence
- Wicker paper - crisis point (attitudes don't predict behavior)
	- Russ Fozio

Self-determination theory
