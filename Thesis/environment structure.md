# Notes
[[fast and frugal heuristics|Fast and frugal heuristics]] are successful because they are leveraging structure in the environment.

Assumption is that [[evolution]] would lead to the exploitation of informative environmental dependencies as this could provide an [[adaptive advantage]]!

**Example**: [[QuickEst heuristic]] relies on skewed distributions

-  most statistical models are designed to operate on datasets where [[mean|means]] and [[variance|variances]] are independent, **however**, Karl Pearson (1897) noted that in natural situations these two measures tend to be **[[correlation|correlated]]**, and thus each can be used as a cue to infer  the  other  (Einhorn  &  Hogarth  1981,  p.  66)

**Example**:
1. **[[noncompensatory information]]**: When potential contribution of new cues diminishes rapidly [[take the best heuristic]] equals or outperforms linear decision strategies
2. **scarce information**: when few cues are known relative to the number of choices/objects [[take the best heuristic]] also outperforms many linear models
3. **[[j-shaped distribution]]**: [[QuickEst heuristic]] performs well when there are many small values and few high values
4. **decreasing populations**: if set of alternatives is decreasing over time (e.g. mating pool) then [[satisficing heuristics]] will outperform rules that sample many alternatives
