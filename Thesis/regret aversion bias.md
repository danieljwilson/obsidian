# Notes
Causes people to anticipate and fear the pain of regret that comes with incurring a loss or forfeiting a reward.

- people try to avoid distress arising from [[errors of commission]] and [[errors of omission]].
- A meta-analysis in this area suggests that anticipated regret is a better predictor of intentions and behavior than other kinds of anticipated negative emotions and evaluations of risk (Brewer et al., 2016).
