# Generalized Linear Models
- Although it is "linear" you can introduce nonlinear features
	- e.g. polynomial regression
- Applications
	- Neural code analysis
	- Behavior analysis
	- Neural engineering
	- Population dynamics
	- ...

# Take Aways
- Most non-linear problems have a large linear component
- If your problem can be posed as a regression or classification use [[general linear model|GLMs]] first!
- [[general linear model|GLM]] weights **do not** imply [[causality|causal]] relationships!
	- just statistical dependence
- Not good practice to play around a bunch with the train/test/validation proportions/technique.
