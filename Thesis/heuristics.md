# Notes
Simple rules to make smart choices quickly with a minimum of information by exploiting the way information is structured in particular environments.

**Building Blocks**:
1. information search
2. stop search
3. make decision

According to Gigerenzer and Todd (1999) [[decision making]] with limited resources is **not** the same as [[optimization under constraints]], since this needs to compute the [[optimality|optimal]] [[stopping point]].

Parpart et al. (2018) showed that [[heuristics]] can emerge from [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian inference]] in the limit of infinitely strong priors.

#### Critiques of [[heuristics]]
> If one cannot predict which heuristics will be used in which environments, determining the heuristic that will be selected from the toolbox for a particular environment, the approach looks dangerously unfalsifiable” (Newell et al., 2003)
