# Notes
**Simple rules** to make **smart choices quickly** with a minimum of information by exploiting the way information is structured in particular environments.

- Based on simple principles of [[information processing]].
- Often consider only a **subset of available information**.
	- ignoring some (noisy) information enables faster and potentially more accurate decisions
- Greek origin, meaning “serving to find out or discover.”
- **Alternative to classical approaches** of [[expected utiliity theory]] and [[subjective expected utility theory]].
- Have been pointed to as the cause of violations of the [[axioms of rational choice]].
- [[system 1]] in [[dual-process model]]

**Building Blocks**:
1. information search
2. stop search
3. make decision

According to Gigerenzer and Todd (1999) [[decision making]] with limited resources is **not** the same as [[optimization under constraints]], since this needs to compute the [[optimality|optimal]] [[stopping point]].

Parpart et al. (2018) showed that [[heuristics]] can emerge from [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian inference]] in the limit of infinitely strong priors. 

[[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] asserted that there are three main [[heuristics]]:
1. [[representativeness heuristic]]: judgments influenced by what is typical
2. [[availability heuristic]]: judgments based on what comes easily to mind
3. [[anchoring and adjustment heuristic]]: judgments relying on what comes first

#### Critiques of [[heuristics]]
> If one cannot predict which heuristics will be used in which environments, determining the heuristic that will be selected from the toolbox for a particular environment, the approach looks dangerously unfalsifiable” (Newell et al., 2003)
