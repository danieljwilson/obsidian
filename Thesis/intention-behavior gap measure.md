# Notes
## Task completion
- When I start a task I complete it
- If I put my mind toward a goal I will then achieve it
- I often set goals that I am unable to reach
- I constantly underestimate how much times things will take
- I overcommit
- I am often running behind schedule

## Routine maintenance
- Sometimes I have days where I get nothing done
- I have a strict schedule for my work and leisure time
- I get up and go to bed at the same time each day

## Goal setting style
- I like to set modest goals so that I am not disappointed
- I break up my goals into small chunks

- Giving up

## Gap
- The grades I expect are the grades I get in my classes
-
