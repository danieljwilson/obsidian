**Questions**
- does this model differ from other models? 
	- If so how?
- does this model make predictions?
	- If so what are they?

#### How do people process the first order/second order gap?
- are people aware of the gap?
- how does it make them feel?
- what is the salience of the gap?

Perhaps worth considering constructing a measure if one doesn't exist.
