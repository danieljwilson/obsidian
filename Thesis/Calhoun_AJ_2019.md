# Notes
## Summary
**Gap**: Internal states shape stimulus responses and decision-making, but we lack methods to identify them.
**Experiment**: Developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from behavioral data and applied it to a dynamic social interaction (song bird during courtship)
**Outcome**: Uncovered three latent states that corresponded to different sensorimotor strategies

**Methods**
- Combined [[hidden markov model]] (HMMs) with [[general linear model|GLMs]]
