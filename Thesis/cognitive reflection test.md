# Notes

Assesses individuals' ability to suppress an intuitive and spontaneous ([[system 1]]) wrong answer in favor of a reflective and deliberative ([[system 2]]) correct answer.

- Some suggestions that it is actually measuring degree of [[reflective cognitive style]] (Baron 2015)
- Others contend it measures math ability (Attali and Erceg both 2020)

**Correlates**
- Across a range of measures of time preference, Ps with higher CRT scores were more patient (had lower discount rates) for short time horizons.
- Across a range of measures of risk preference, Ps with higher CRT scores were less risk-averse for gains and less risk-seeking for losses. (In other words, the reflection effect is reduced and even eliminated for Ps with high CRT scores.)
- Men scored higher than women on the CRT.
- ==Other positive associations==:
	- more patient [[delay discounting]] (Frederick, 2005; Oeschssler etal., 2009)
	- greater reliance on expected value (Frederick,2005; Cokely & Kelley, 2009)
	- greater reliance on base rates (Oeschssler et al.,2009)
	- greater reliance on [[law of large numbers]] (Obrecht et al., 2009)
	- reduced susceptibility to [[framing effect bias]] (Frederick, 2005)
	- reduced susceptibility to [[conjunction bias]] (Oeschssler et al., 2009)
	- reduced susceptibility to [[probability matching behavior]] (Koehler & James, 2010)
- ==Does not relate to==:
	- [[anchoring bias]] (Oeschssler et al., 2009)
	- [[frequency bias]] (Obrecht et al., 2009)
	- [[biasblind spot]] (West, Meserve & Stanovich, 2012)

**Questions**
- A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
- If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
- In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?

## Thoughts
I think that this might be more of a test of context recognition. Do you recognize that someone is trying to trick you?

Also agree that [[numeracy]] is a big part of it...
