# Notes
When asked to find angle measures of a triangle given all three side lengths, we are in the [[sss case|SSS case]].

So, if we are given $a$, $b$, and $c$ as in the figure below, we are in this case.

The procedure for finding the three angle measures is as follows.
1. Find the measure of the angle opposite the longest side using the [[law of cosines]]. This will be the obtuse angle (if there is one).
2. Find the measure of either of the remaining angles using the [[law of sines]]. These angles will be acute.
3. Find the measure of the last angle using the [[angle sum formula]], $A + B + C = 180^{\circ}$.
