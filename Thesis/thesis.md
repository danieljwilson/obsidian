## Cendri
**Ads**
- Online ad paper
	- ad-blocker follow-up
		- does it decrease self-esteem?
		- does it influence other hedonic indulgences?
			- keep track of what people eat
			- how much they sleep
			- time on social media
		- i.e. do ads activate our worst impulses

- show people ads and then assess self perception
- gender effects
- try to identify mechanism
- check in with Martin's wife about types of advertising
- ads can effect self-control

- ads are becoming sneakier in some ways...influencers
- we banned smoking advertising
	- have there been natural experiments done on this


**Heuristics**
- We don't know how different biases affect different people
	- walkability scores and indulging in vices?
- Heterogenity of heuristics and interventions
- What are the impediments and biases for our population (SONA/UTSC students)?
	- what are the decision fallabilities? 
	- x weakness affects 90% of the population
- Qualitative study
	- When do you not make rational decisions?
	- Does executive control have predictive power?
	- Correlations between self-control failings?
	- Factor analysis: which temptations go together?
		- food/alcohol/etc. maybe cluster together
	- Yoel: write about their obstacles?
		- twitter/instagram...
		- twitter: time of day effects...2am tweeting = lapse of self-control
	- Experience sampling study

- Cendri still interested in self-control flashcards

## Yoel
- what I have done
- the book 
	- an ontology of failure
		- looking back: in what previous ecological context were they in fact optimal
		- looking forward
	- the experiment we just came up with
- the social media work

- effect size of bias (Stroop)
	- effect size on life outcomes (retirement)
