# Notes
## Summary
**Topline Idea**
[[inhibitory control|Inhibitory control]] a critical [[executive control|executive function]]

**Why?**
Contributes to many things:
- [[attention]]
- performance
- physical well-being
- [[well being|mental well-being]]

**Question**
If our level of [[inhibitory control]] fluctuates, what are the **mechanisms** that explain this fluctuation?

**Methods**
- 4 weeks
- 12 participants
- app (*InhibiSense*)
- heart rate monitor
- ecological momentary assessment

**Analysis**
Used [[generalized estimating equation]] (GEE) and [[gradient boosting]] [[tree models]] fitted with features extracted from participants’phone use and sensor data to predict their stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), an objective metric used to measure an individual’s [[inhibitory control]], and identify the predictive digital markers.
