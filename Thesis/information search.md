# Notes
**Two variants**
1. simulate and forecast the consequences of oneâ€™s actions on the  basis of past data stored in **memory**
2. **acquire** novel data before deciding
---
- [[information search]] key element of [[cognition]]
- unbounded search not feasible
- many [[normative theories of choice]] and [[descriptive theories of choice]] such as [[expected utiliity theory]], [[subjective expected utility theory]], and [[prospect theory]], **ignore the process of [[information search]]**.
- in the lab many choices are **[[decisions from descriptions]]** - all of the necessary information is presented. These can be called [[static decision tasks]] (Edwards 1962a).
- as opposed to [[decisions from experience]]
- in everyday life we usually **do not know the probabilities** present in our choices (Camerer & Weber, 1992, p. 325)
- **how** one searches affects the [[choice]] they make
