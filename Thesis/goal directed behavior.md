# Notes
The capacity to select actions on the basis of desired goals

**Two requirements**
1. the capacity to **anticipate action outcomes**, i.e., the effects produced by the execution of actions, on the basis of previously learned action-outcome contingencies. 
2. the capacity to **choose between different anticipated outcomes** depending on their **current value** (computed on the basis of the nature of the rewards and the animal's current motivational state).

- based on [[action -> outcome]] learning
- requires selectively attending to a subset of the sensory input at the expense of the rest of the input
- a surveillance mechanism must be in operation, so that deviant or novel events may bring about reorientation of attention and avoidance of potential hazards

### Thoughts
Not sure I agree with the stated first requirement? Isn't this only the case in [[model-based reinforcement learning]] scenarios? In [[model-free reinforcement learning]] there is no anticipation of outcome, just an action value that has been learned for each state, no?
