# Notes
## Summary
Used Neuropixels probes to record from ~30,000 neurons in 42 brain regions of mice performing a visual discrimination task.
- Midbrain neurons were activated before contralateral choices and suppressed before ipsilateral choices
- Forebrain neurons could prefer either side.
- Brain-wide pre-stimulus activity predicted engagement in individual trials and in the overall task, with enhanced subcortical but suppressed neocortical activity during engagement
