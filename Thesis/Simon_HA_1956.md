# Notes
## Summary
Motivation
>...much  attention  has  been  focused  on  the characterization  of  rational  choice,  and because  the latter  topic  has  been  a  central  concern  in  economics,  the  theory of decision  making  has  become  a  natural meeting  ground   for   psychological   and economic  theory.

- [[pyschology|Psychology]] refers to [[adaptive behavior]]
- [[economics|Economics]] refers to [[rational behavior]]
	- Assumes a much greater ability to take in and process information than the psychological approach
- **Observed** behavior seems more aligned with [[adaptive behavior]] than [[rational behavior]]
- [[adaptive behavior|Adaptive behavior]] far short of [[optimality|optimal]]
- Organisms tend to **[[satisficing|satisfice]]** rather than **[[optimality|optimize]]**

Simon's Question:
> How simple a set of choice mechanisms can we  postulate  and  still  obtain  the  gross features  of  observed adaptive  choice  behavior?

- The [[decision environment|environment]] key component of [[adaptive behavior]]
- Description of a simple organism and its environment:
	1. It has only a single goal: food
	2. It has no problem of [[maximization]] (i.e. additional food is of no use)
	3. The nature of its needs and environment sharply limit its planning horizon (food is randomly distributed in this thought experiment)
	4. The combination of the organism's needs and the environment create natural separation of "means" and "ends"...locomotion is only a means of getting to food

- Simon then runs through some math to describe the branching choice structure of this simple organism
	- Tree structure determined by number of choices available at each branching point, and the length of the "vision" (in effect this could be temporal or spatial)
