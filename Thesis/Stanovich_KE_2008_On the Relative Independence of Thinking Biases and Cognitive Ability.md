# Notes
## Summary
[[rationality]] vs. [[cognitive ability]]
- many [[cognitive biases]] are failures in [[rational choice]] not [[cognitive ability]]
- typically [[intelligence]] assessments do not test for [[cognitive biases]]

Generally, theories in [[heuristics]] and [[cognitive biases|biases]] believe in [[dual-process model]] of cognition, which assumes [[cognitive biases|biases]] are a universal property of our [[heuristics|heruistic]] system of [[cognition]] and [[decision making]].

Computational power needed to override a primed [[heuristics|heuristic]] response might be correlated with [[intelligence]]

**Disentangling**
[[Daniel Kahneman]] (2000) believed that [[correlation]] between [[intelligence]] and resistance to [[cognitive biases]] could be due to [[within-subjects design]]. In this experimental setup subjects get cued that they are in a situation where they should override their [[heuristics|heuristic]] system response. 

A [[between-subjects design]] would be a stricter evaluation, and have higher [[ecological validity]].

**Note:** Used SAT scores to assess [[cognitive ability]].

**Experiment 1: Classic Heuristics and Biases Effects**
- [[base-rate bias|Base-rate problem]]
- [[framing effect bias|Framing problem]] (Asian disease)
- [[conjunction bias]]
- [[outcome bias]]

**Experiment 2: “Less is More” Effects**
- Gamble
- Proportion dominance Problem 1
- Proportion dominance Problem 2

**Experiment 3: Honoring Sunk Costs and Absolute Versus Relative Savings**
- [[sunk cost fallacy]]
- Absolute versus relative savings

**Experiment 4: Nonseparability of Risk and Benefit Judgments**

**Experiment 5: Omission Bias**

**Experiment 6: Reference Dependent Preferences—WTA/WTP and the Certainty Effect**

**Experiment 7: Myside Bias**

**Experiment 8: Heuristics and Biases That Do Associate With Cognitive Ability**
- [[probabilistic reasoning]]: denominator neglect
- [[probabilistic reasoning]]: probability matching vs. maximizing
- [[belief bias]]:
