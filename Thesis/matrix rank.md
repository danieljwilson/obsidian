[[linear algebra]]
[[multicollinearity]]
[[covariance matrix]]
[[inverse matrix]]

# Notes
A matrix's rank refers to how many of the [[variable|variables]] are [[independent variable|independent]].

- if the [[matrix rank]] is lower than the number of columns/predictors then there is likely [[multicollinearity]] happening...
- If you try to find the [[inverse matrix]] of a matrix with a [[matrix rank]] lower than the number of columns you will get an **error** (error message may be `Singular matrix`)
