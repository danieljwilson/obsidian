# Optimal Control
- can have multiple goals

![[optimal_control_cost.png]]

- Feedforward only early (first 200ms), then feedback can take effect
- Feedback and feedforward control independent in healthy people
- **State**: Collection of variables that describe context (internal/external factors)
- **Action**
- **Goal**: Maximize reward over time
	- reward can also be discounted over time
- **Value** function is future reward expected for each state
- **Policy** determines action


# Takeaways
- We don't necessarily know the **ideal** state
- Key concepts:
	- control
	- [[utility]]
	- [[policy]]
- partially observable [[markov decision process|markov decision process]] is an interactive [[hidden markov model]]
