# Notes
Builds off of idea of [[technical debt]], where systems contain [[cruft]] that make them harder to understand...in research this is code that you write that is hacked together and therefore not easy for other people or future you to interpret/build on.

The interest payment on the [[research debt]] is the extra effort it takes to make changes to the project.
