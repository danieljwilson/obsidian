[[autoregressive glm]]

# Notes
- Class of models that map:
	- High dimensional inputs -> Scalar output
- **Linear filter + Nonlinear function + Noise**
- Convexity of [[optimization]]
	- unique solution
- Describes *statistical dependence* between variables - but it can arise in many ways!
- Need to be careful when you have **more parameters than data points**
	- [[regularization|Regularize!]]
