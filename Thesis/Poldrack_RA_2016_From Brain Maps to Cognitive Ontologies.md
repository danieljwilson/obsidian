# Notes
## Summary
Major goal of [[cognitive science]] is to understand how brain systems are connected to our mental functions.

They claim to be interested in an informatics-driven approach.

Believe there is a critical role for formal cognitive [[ontologies]] to help guide theory.

Difficult to isolate specific mental functions with standard psychological tasks

Referring to mappings between brain systems and mental functions:
> We argue that the standard approach to neuroimaging is fundamentally unable to deliver such selective mappings
