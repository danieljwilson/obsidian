# Notes

**History**
In 1904, Charles Spearman famously observed that performance was correlated across a spectrum of seemingly unrelated tasks (Spearman, 1904). He proposed that a dominant general factor “**g**” accounts for correlations in performance between all cognitive tasks, with residual differences across tasks reflecting task-specific factors.
