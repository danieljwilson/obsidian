# Notes
Occur  when  the relevant [[mindware]] has been learned and is available for use in the override process, but does not get **applied**.

- happens when people fail to detect the **situational cues** indicating that the heuristically primed response needs to be **overridden** and an **analytically derived response** substituted
- [[Keith E. Stanovich]] refers to this as [[heuristic override detection]]

## Thoughts
The [[heuristics]] aspect of this seems to be a bit narrowly focused on traditional JDM bias tasks. 

I think that there are many types of decisions that we try and override - and they all require the relevant [[mindware]] (the opposite of a [[judgment error of comprehension]]), the ability to detect or differentiate between normatively good/bad behavior/choice and then the [[sustained inhibition]] or effort required to carry out the correct action.
