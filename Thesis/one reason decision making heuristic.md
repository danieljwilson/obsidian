[[one good reason heuristic]]

# Notes
Good reasoning often requires just a ==single piece of information==, i.e. the most important [[attributes|attribute]].

Doesn't mean that more than one cue can't be considered, but as soon as you find one that differentiates between the two options you go with it.

Advantage: since it only requires one attribute you do not have to convert other relevant attributes into a [[common currency]].

- Called [[one good reason heuristic]] by Gigerenzer & Goldstein in [1]
- Called [[one reason decision making heuristic]] in [[Binz_M_2020_Heuristics From Bounded Meta-Learned Inference]]

**Examples**
- [[take the best heuristic|Take the best heuristic]]: searches for cues/attributes in the order of their learned validity (how often it has correctly arbitrated in the past).
- [[take the last heuristic|Take the last heuristic]]: cue used to make last decision checked first
- [[minimalist heuristic|Minimalist heuristic]]: select cues/attributes in random order
