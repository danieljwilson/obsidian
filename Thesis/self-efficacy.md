[[efficacy gap]]

# Notes
A personal judgment of "how well one can execute courses of action required to deal with prospective situations".

Or, simpler, the perception of one's own **ability to reach a goal**.

- it seems to refer to a person's sense of **agency**, or believing in oneself...
- reminds me a bit of [[Carol Dweck]]'s [[growth mindset]]...
- Does not say anything directly about how that matches reality...
- A first "derivative" would be to look at the gap between one's personal judgment and reality.
