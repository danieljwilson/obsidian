# Notes
## Summary
Describes changes in the electrical properties of the skin.

- also known as ==EDA==
- Activation of the SNS stimulates the [[sudomotor nerves]], inducing sweat secretion (hence change in EDA)
- Can be used as a proxy for [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) activation since [[sudomotor nerves]] are **only** innervated by the sympathetic branch of the [[autonomic nervous system]]
- increased EDA has been found to correlate with many kinds of affective and cognitive experiences, including feelings of stress, anxiety, and fear, as well as physical exertion, attention, and high cognitive load. 
- note that you can get different readings/activation levels from different locations at the same time...
