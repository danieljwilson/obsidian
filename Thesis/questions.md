**Dimensionality Reduction**
- What does it mean to say: The brain has fewer degrees of freedom at its disposal than the number of neurons at play?

- What is a latent dimension?
- what are canonical "eigenfaces"?
- what are up-down phases?
- what does it mean when they say they sorted the neurons by "a manifold embedding algorithm"?
