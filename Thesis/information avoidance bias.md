- can be strategic
- can have immediate [[hedonic benefits]] by preventing negative psychological consequences of knowing information
- long term usually has [[negative utility]]
	- missing information that is important to make good decisions
	- can contribute to polarization of political opinions and media bias

- inattention
- biased interpretation of information (e.g. [[confirmation bias]])
- some forms of forgetting



**Example**
- Research has shown that investors are less likely to check their portfolio online when the stock market is down than when it is up, which has been termed the [[ostrich effect]] (Karlsson et al., 2009).
- People can fail to return to clinics to get medical test results (Sullivan et al., 2004).
