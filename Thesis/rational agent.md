Simon  (1955,  p.  99)  later  described  the  perfect  rational  or  economic  man  ([[homo economicus]]) on this basis as a man who:
>...is assumed to have knowledge of the relevant aspects of his environment which, if not absolutely  complete,  is  at  least  impressively  clear  and voluminous.  He  is  assumed  also  to have  a  well-organized  and  stable  system  of  preferences,  and  a  skill  in  computation  that enables him to calculate, for the alternatives of action that are available to him, which of these will permit him to reach the highest attainable point on his preference scale.
