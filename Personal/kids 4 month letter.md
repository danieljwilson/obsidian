# 4 Month Birthday
#writing


Dear Amos and Rilka,

This birthday arrives just 2 days after your one year of existence anniversary, which took place on November 11. This was the day, one year ago, that your mom’s and my cells happened to bump into each other in her Fallopian tubes. An encounter that started a whole, truly incredible process, in which those cells joined together into a single cell, called a zygote. Can you even believe that? That you were once ONE single cell? At that time you were about one tenth of a millimetre in size. Which means you are now more than 5000 times taller than you were a year ago. Nice work.

It will be easy to remember your one year zygote anniversary going forward as it also happens to be the date that the armistice was signed, ending the First World War, between Germany and the Entente (which is, as I understand it, how the Allied Powers referred to themselves). They call this the “formal” end of the war (it was technically just a ceasefire), as the official end of the war wouldn’t happen until June of the next year in Versailles, where they signed the Treaty of Versailles. In this “formal” armistice agreement it stated that hostilities had ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. However, they actually signed the agreement at 5:12 (Germany) and 5:20 (the Entente) that same morning. This meant, crazily, that fighting was able to continue up until 11am, even though commanders had been told about the ceasefire. In total, nearly 11,000 people died on November 11th, before the agreement went “into effect”. Largely this was caused by American commander John Pershing, who didn’t approve of the armistice. He later had to face a congressional hearing because of the insane death toll that last morning (which included 3500 Americans), when he, and everyone else in power, knew the war was over. The upshot being that he now has a square in downtown Los Angeles named after him - which I used to live a couple of blocks from. 

For people in France, it will also be easy to remember your 4 month birthday, as it lands on the same day that ISIL launched a terrorist attack in Paris, killing 130 people, most at a nightclub called Bataclan, that your mom and I have biked by numerous times since arriving in Paris. 

What’s up with all these gloomy historical details you ask? Fair question. I admit it doesn’t seem to be in the celebratory spirit of today’s event, where we are marking the 123 complete revolutions of the earth on its axis since you first started using your lungs. But there are two important points I think they illustrate.

POINT 1
The world is a truly bonkers place. We - your mom and I - have been here a while, so we have managed, largely, to get used to things. But that doesn’t mean that we have figured a great deal out. There is so much that is weird, or strange, or unusual and we understand almost none of it. Every day we are playing you music but we don’t even understand why it is that we even like music. Your grandmother, who has been here in the world for over 70 years, regularly goes to a counsellor to try and help her understand her own life and feelings. We don’t even really know why people need to sleep! And things that we think we know, when you dig into them a bit, often reveal themselves to be built on pretty shaky foundations. Just this past week your mother and I were trying to understand what it is that is so bad about high fructose corn syrup (since we knew that it was “bad”), only to find out that there was almost zero convincing evidence for coming to this conclusion.

Of course, this also means that there is an incredible amount to be discovered, whole realms of possibility and curiosity for you to explore. You’ve already started your first rudimentary explorations of this bonkers world, and I am so interested to see where they eventually lead. 

POINT 2 
Our lives, and the vast majority of people on this planet are great. While thinking about war can make you a bit pessimistic about our world, and the humans that inhabit it, I feel like it also provides a valuable point of contrast. How much better is our world now, than then? How much easier and frankly, more fun, has my life been (and hopefully will yours be) than someone who had to go sit in cold muddy trenches at seven in the morning on November 11th, 1918, being ordered to murder strangers while at the same time avoiding getting murdered by strangers, while, simultaneously, diplomats were sipping morning tea, after having signed a ceasefire that they thought would be neat if it didn’t go into effect until 11am, seeing as it was the 11th day of the 11th month and all.

Living in a foreign country has given us the opportunity to meet a whole slew of strangers, and they have been, almost unfailingly kind and generous. Rilka’s first encounter with a French person in Paris, after being dropped off by our taxi driver at our door, was to get a kiss on the cheek from a totally unknown teenage boy (who had first asked your mother whether it was okay). We’ve also been picked up on the side of the road by a random French couple who happened to see us walking while carrying you guys, and just wanted to give us a lift. That said, there are “Pershings” out there, who you should always keep an eye out for (even if they have their own square), but its worth keeping in mind that they are a very small minority, and even they aren’t, usually, entirely bad. 

This may all seem a bit complicated, but I am writing it because as I observe you both beginning to emerge, interacting with the world instead of just existing in it, you will both encounter this complexity, as well as manifest it. And I think that, for the most part, you’re going to really like it. It’s kind of like buying a present for someone way in advance, that you know they are really going to like, but now you have to wait for what seems like *forever* to give it to them.

Since your last birthday so many things have already changed, marking this emergence. Amos led the way, but you are both now laughing with cause, which is, frankly, delightful. You are also just beginning to notice each other. Rilka, you seem to be figuring it out first, looking and reaching out to touch your brother. You have also both started actually reaching for your toys, and then, usually, banging them into your faces. Amos has started really jumping around in the jolly jumper, while Rilka seems to take things a bit more cautiously - though perhaps it is just that she is too focussed on drooling to find the time to bounce. You’ve given your first smiles to total strangers - first Rilka in the Jardin de Tuileries when a Spanish family came to admire you, and then both of you the following week at the Louvre when someone came and spoke directly to you. You’re sleeping (more or less) through the night, and devouring bottles of milk literally 10 times the size of those you were able to handle in your first week.
When we go out for walks in the stroller you open your eyes as wide as you can and look around at the world as if you have never seen the likes. Which often is true. You are making noises which, if you squint, kind of sound like first attempts at communication. Last night your mother and I had a conversation about what your first meal of “real” food would be (we decided on banana). These may be fairly banal milestones, but many milestones are. It’s just the accumulation of those stones that starts to build a substantial pile. And as we look back over these first four months of Rilka and Amos in the world, from atop that pile, I feel at once nostalgic for the pre-pile days, excited for the continued rise in altitude as the pile continues to accumulate, but most of all happy to be here, right now, enjoying the view.

Love,
Dad
