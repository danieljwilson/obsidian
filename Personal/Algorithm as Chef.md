# Notes
Idea is that we can think of an algorithm as a chef with a specialty. 
- He has a recipe
- That recipe requires inputs
- Those inputs can be specified in the recipe, or can just say take the number of eggs you receive
- So you can alter the recipe by altering the inputs
- Parallel programming is a bunch of chefs making the same recipe
- Grid search is tweaking he recipe slightly
