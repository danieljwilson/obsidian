# 6 Month Birthday
#writing

Another birthday. Another location. After half a year of life you have, well, **we** have, celebrated birthdays in Toronto, Caribou River, Paris, Villemus, Provence and, now, Nice, Cote D’Azur.

Speaking of celebrations we had a second celebration of my own recent birthday, my 42nd, this past Wednesday with a lunch on the beach. Unlike you, I will remember this one. I had complained on the way down of the bright sun, and how I needed to get myself a new pair of sunglasses, to replace a pair that had jostled out of my pocket while jogging with you in the stroller in Manosque in December, never to be found again. Once we were seated at the beach restaurant your mom suggested I open my first present, which she claimed was from you two, before the meal. It was a replacement of the exact sunglasses that I had lost, the Persol 714. I was delighted, naturally.

Your own expressions of **complaint** and **delight** are two of the most common emotions you tend to express, over the course of your day. Though, truth be told, I may be mistaking mirth for delight. And with you, Amos, at times there is some question about whether your mirth may perhaps be entering into mania territory. 

After six months we have become fairly adept at recognizing the various situations in which you might tend to express these emotions.

### COMPLAINT
* Hunger
	* Pre-feeding
	* While feeding (burp break)
* Frustration
	* Can’t roll onto back
	* Can’t reach toy
* Boredom
	* Had enough of current activity (e.g. Jolly Jumper) or trying to request some activity (beyond lying on the floor)
* Fatigue
	* End of enjoyment of being alert in the world
* Pain
	* Rilka’s two head bonks in one day (courtesy of me, your dad)

### Delight
* Being flown around the apartment
* Bicycle legs (with additional zuperts)
* The falling swaddle game
* Your mom’s “arms out" "arms in" game
* Fart noises
* Great blue heron squawks
* Nonsense words that sound funny, like “plop” and "doing”
* Swinging from arms (for Amos)
* The up and down finale in the Jolly Jumper
* General nonsense

As I write out this list of delights I am struck by the images it brings to mind of two adults (me and your mom in this case) working so hard to entertain a couple of infants with no comprehension of language or the world. As someone who has actually spent some time working in the entertainment industry, I have often heard producers talk about trying to figure out what their audience “wants”.

That’s basically what we are trying to do. Just trying a bit of everything and seeing what sticks. In comparison to my previous career, this version of audience satisfaction providence is both easier and more challenging. Easier in the sense that audience feedback in this case is in realtime, and completely genuine. And easier in the sense that, lets be honest, your bar is pretty low. But harder as the mental model I have of the world I could assume was largely shared with the audience watching the documentaries I worked on, but with you, I have to admit that I have very little access to your world model.

Beyond complaints and delight (or mirth), there are other distinct emotions we get to witness.

**SATISFACTION**
This makes me think of Amos drinking milk like someone getting the world’s best foot massage, or, perhaps even more accurate, but darker, getting a hit of some really fantastic drug. You drink, Amos, with your eyelids half closed, fluttering, with your eyes rolling back in your head. Your arms are akimbo, often held aloft above your head, as milk escapes out the corners of your mouth and down into your neck crease.

Rilka also enjoys her feeds, though you are perhaps not quite as lost to the world as your brother during the event. There are moments when you get in a good groove though, and your left leg just starts pumping in time to your sucks. It also seems like you are starting to get a sense of satisfaction from your newfound hobby of standing. This has been going on for a couple of weeks now. “Standing”, admittedly, is a pretty generous description, but you have developed a definite fondness for locking your legs and supporting your full weight when we put you in an upright position. And can’t help but interpret your happy facial expression as just a little bit self-satisfied in these moments.

**SURPRISE->CONFUSION/ENJOYMENT**
Frankly, I am surprised, myself, that you don't find the world **more** surprising. Almost everything you see, when we go out on our walks, is totally new, and, I would assume, weird, to you. But you are pretty nonchalant about the whole thing. Perhaps when everything is strange nothing is strange. 

That said, there are moments each day where you do seem to find things strange. I am thinking, for example, of the 10:30am meal, where we have started giving you pureed vegetables halfway through. Each time we switch from one flavour, say squash, to the next, perhaps green beans, there is a moment, as the spoon enters your mouth, where you get a very concerned look on your face. 

The other main source of startle, is probably, I have to admit, me, your dad. I have a certain level of expertise when it comes to the odd fun “surprise”, just ask your mom, and I have begun sharing that talent with you, sometimes in the form of a quick “boo”, or a sudden room entry. The reactions on this one are mixed. Amos generally gets quiet for a moment, and then, as is his MO, begins laughing. Rilka follows up her moment of silence with a look that ranges on any given occasion from confusion, to concern to a face that kind of looks like she is smelling a pretty bad fart (if she wasn’t, as you both seem to be, pretty immune to the smell of farts)

**INTEREST**
As I have mentioned, feeding is definitely high on your list of satisfying activities. However, lately it seems that even higher on the list is the combo experience of the TV dinner, when you get fed in the living room, while I, and/or your mother, are watching something. Even though we have you facing away from the TV on your backs, you manage to crane your heads back - it doesn’t seem very comfortable - so that you are both sucking on your bottle and watching the latest episode of HBO’s Succession. Whatever you are seeing on that LCD monitor is definitely capturing your full attention.

Much lower-fi, but also, recently, of great interest, are your crinkly squares. A month ago, you couldn’t have cared less about these things - these things being 3 inch vinyl crinkly cube with gaudy colours - but for whatever reason they have suddenly an inexplicable managed to move directly to the pinnacle of your Malzlow’s hierarchy of needs.

It makes me curious what next month's "crinkly square”, will be, and the month after that. And on a more general note it makes me curious to imagine what will also provoke the other emotions, going forward. What will delight you? Make you laugh? Make you frustrated?
