### Running for Mayor of Toronto

**Platform**
• 2nd home high house taxes
• would need to also increase taxes to maintain income rate when home prices went down
• Gardener underground
• replace with combo of affordable housing, park, "real" bike path, and commerce (pedestrian area)
• One way streets to allow for major bike thoroughfairs
• 30km/hr speed limit in city
• What percentage of Toronto actually owns?? And what ages are they?
• figuring out what my priorities are so that I can apportion that time appropriately.
