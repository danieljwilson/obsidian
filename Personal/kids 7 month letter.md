Dear Rilka and Amos,

I am sitting on a white slatted bench under a trellis on the edge of the pedestrian pathway that runs the length of the Promenade d’Anglais. Rilka, you have just, moments ago, closed your eyes and gone to sleep. Amos, you have a view of the Mediterranean Sea and the people promenading (or jogging) along the promenade. There is a wide range of people.

I’ll note the next 10 for you.

1. Lady in her 60s with short hair walking a long sausage style dog on a leash, whose feet have to move very quickly to keep up.
2. Elderly couple dressed in winter palette clothing and shoes combining comfort and good taste, out for a walk
3. Family speaking German, parents on either side, holding hands of boy of about 8 years. The dad with a black backpack.
4. Lady in her 50s wearing a white Canada Goose jacket with short hair dyed red. White nike runners and a pink backpack.
5. Lady pushing a curly haired kid who looks totally bored in a stroller. The boy is perhaps 2 and looks like he is probably pretty good at walking. Lady seems old to be a mother but young to be a grandmother. She has on stylish sparkly Converse Chucks.
6. Guy jogger, 40s, short cropped greying hair, long striped socks pulled up almost to his knees.
7. Pair of ladies both wearing large rectangular purple lensed sunglasses. I am guessing they are in their late 50s.
8. Mixed race couple with Japanese dog. White guy with glasses, black girl with braided hair. Very stylish, look to be in their mid/late 30s.
9. Very overweight couple carrying matching bottles of Lipton iced tea. In their 30s. Guy has a large man purse.
10. Asian guy dressed all in black. Late 40s. Put a plastic bottle in the garbage can across from us, then went to sit on the bench next to a girl with a shopping bag. They are looking out to sea, the sun in their faces.


As I look out to sea, and toward the horizon, I see a plane arcing across the sky, having taken off from Nice airport, 5km away. Looking up I can see the vapor trails of more planes, crisscrossing. I have an app that lets me see where planes in my area are going from and too in real time. The one that just took off from the airport above is on its way to Amsterdam. It is currently at 3700 feet, and climbing,traveling at 224 kts/hr, which you would multiply by 1.852 to get km. Why anyone uses knots as a measure of speed is beyond me.


I was just interrupted as three well dressed wrinkly French ladies came over to say hello to you. They were very impressed. The same happened in the grocery store earlier. To be honest, you two have served as my best access point to practicing French. So thanks for that.


Now a lady just went by pushing a stroller with a pug sitting in it, with an umbrella shielding the pug from the sun.


You may, at this point, be asking what is going on with this letter. Why the random stream of observations, and what do they have to do with your 7th month celebration?


There are two reasons.


The first reason is that I have been thinking about the idea of “observation” quite a bit lately, as I interact with, and watch you two operating on your own. I feel like you are reaching a point where your brains are starting to understand that there is you, and then there is the world, and that you can learn about the world by observing it. You are using these observations to build your very first (undoubtedly very wrong) mental models of the world.


In the early days there was just stimuli. And you reacted to it, but you were mainly just subject to it. But now you are developing the first glimmers of agency, reaching and looking and (at least in Rilka’s case) moving. Trying to shape your input in order to understand your environment, and the larger world. You hear a noise and you want to see what caused it. You see an interesting toy and you want to move to touch it.


The second reason is that I have been thinking, recently, about memory - which is of course closely tied to observation. As I start outlining my memoir during our walks, I have been thinking about my own early memories, and about how vague and inaccessible those memories have become. You are at a strange point in time where you starting to “remember” things - like how to roll over, or shake the toy that makes the fun noise - but none of these memories will be accessible to you in the future. You will not remember the day you learn to crawl. But I am hoping that through these letters, and the videos and photos we have been taking, you will be able to regain this memory of yourself later down the road. It makes me happy that I can pass my observations of you, on to you in this way.


That said, documentation is not the same as memory. I have started this year to, finally, keep a daily journal. I say “finally” as it is something I have wanted to do for a long time, knowing how glad a future version of myself would be to have these observations set down in permanent ink. And yet, I simply didn’t do it. That was a mistake. A mistake that makes me think that I may**require**you two to keep journals, even from early days. Nothing onerous, but just capturing a few ideas and thoughts or experiences each day. Mainly to get the habit ingrained. But also because it is so hard to access previous versions of ourselves, and these small notes serve as a bread crumb trail to our previous experiences and states of mind.


Finally, thinking about observation and memory in this way has helped me step back and appreciate how incredibly fortunate I have been to have been free to spend these past seven months with you. To observe you. And, already, to remember you.


Love,
Dad
