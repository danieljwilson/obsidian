# 10 Month Birthday

Dear Rilka and Amos,

We are on day three of "deconfinement" in Nice. Yesterday on my bike ride I passed by numerous parks full of people, for the first time in two months. It was really nice, and it made me look forward to finally getting a chance to explore those parks with you, now that you, Rilka are crawling like a champion, and you Amos are, well, improving his rolling at least. 

We watched a video recently of kids who didn’t like grass, which has made me curious to see your own reactions, now that we can finally go to the park and have our own grass-time. Watching the kids in the video doing their utmost to avoid grass contact was both surprising and quite entertaining, but it also made me try and consider your experience of the world with a bit more thoughtfulness. I came across a hypothesis by a scientist who believes that the cause of kids’ desire to avoid grass is due to the fact that you have so many neural connections between your body and brain, which have not yet been pruned down, as they are in adults. This means that sensations can be incredibly intense and overwhelming, which makes the reactions of kids to grass sensible, when you consider the level of complexity grass manifests in comparison to the smooth predictable floors you are usually in contact with. It also made me think of how you, Amos, love to go around with just your pointer finger sticking out to touch things. Perhaps this is your way of limiting your tactile exposure so that you can try and make sense of the incoming signals without being overwhelmed.

I have also, as of late, been learning a bit about what is called Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. This has made me think more about your world as well, as many people pursuing the goal of achieving AGI think of a 12 or 18 month old baby as the “gold standard” for AGI. The idea is that you come into the world with minimal mental architecture - essentially you are programmed to learn - and you use this very simple operating system of sorts to develop mental models of the world, of increasing accuracy and complexity. Already, according to people studying this stuff, you have likely learned about concepts such as:
* object permanence
* spatiotemporal continuity
* solidity
* rigidity
* contact causality
* inertia
* transfer of momentum
* stability **and**
* basic support

And you are in the process of figuring out:
* gravity
* weight
* attachment
* centre of mass **and**
* shape constancy

You are essentially little scientists, or as scientist Josh Tennenbaum thinks of it, baby coders, writing yourself new programs in order to understand, predict and navigate your world, and then constantly iterating as you attempt to improve the accuracy and usefulness of your internal models.

Learning about AGI has also made me think about your future world. Some estimates put the development of successful AGI at 2040, or when I am in my early 60s, and you will still not be old enough to buy a beer in the US. That means that you may, potentially, be able to reap the benefits of AGI for your entire adult lives. I really like this idea - that your “starting point” and the starting point of your world might be different than my own, and in many respects different in positive ways.

You both, of course, are also different as compared to a month ago. And while we do not have access to the updated internal code you have been hacking away on, we do get to watch you executing that code each day.

To that end, as with last month, I am providing a list of some notable new abilities, likes and peccadilloes encountered over the past 30 days.

#### Amos
**Movement**
There have not been any dramatic changes but it seems like you are ever so slowly starting to consider the merits of crawling. You now have a tendency to push up on your arms, lifting your upper body off the ground, to look around, instead of simply lifting all of your limbs off the ground. Your legs still aren’t terribly interested in helping out at this point. Though when you are put in a standing position they are much less floppy than before, and when we would you up you now experiment with tensing them and making them rigid. You also often try and bounce on them when held in this position, as you learned to do in your beloved jolly jumper. So perhaps, as some babies do, you may skip crawling altogether and move directly to hopping.

**Vocal**
No major changes on this front, though in the last days it does seem that your vocal production has increased a bit both in volume and frequency. Plus you have added a popping sound you like to make that I think you discovered when sucking in your pureed vegetable meals. Also, it seems that you have increased your frustration sounds in situations when you are on the floor and have knocked all of your toys out of reach and your lifted arms and legs are not propelling you toward them.

**Physical**
No major changes to report. 

**Action**
A few neat actions from this past month include:
* your reaction (one of pure and complete hilarity) to the coussin peuteur “you” bought your mother for mother’s day. 
* sitting on the table on the balcony, how you like to rock back and forth on the rickety table, as well as latch your mouth on the railing and watch the scene unfolding below.
* your enjoyment of tearing up the protective floor tiles we have for you and then moving it around and looking at it from all angles
* you have gotten a bit better in your seated -> lying transition, keeping your head lifted while your body makes contact first.

#### Rilka
**Movement**
Mostly you have just continued to get more comfortable with your crawling and cruising this month. I noticed earlier this week that your knees are slightly bruised from all the crawling you are doing. You have developed two distinct crawling speeds - slow and emergency (i.e. someone left an iPad on the floor). There was also a moment this past week when you were on the bed with both your mom and I and you were holding yourself up on her legs and then for a moment you just let go, and stood on your own. It was so weird to see that, and so weird to think that so soon it will be completely normal.

**Vocal**
More of the same on this front, which means lots of expressing yourself. Along with the odd fake laugh.

**Physical**
This goes for both of you, but I noticed it more with you, Rilka, when I bought new outfits for both you and Amos on Monday. My plan was to buy something that you could where for a while and I was hesitating between the 12 month and 18 month sizes. But when I looked at the 18 month clothes they seemed so giant that I ended up opting for the 12. And then, when we got home, and I put the pants on that I had got you they fit perfectly. Right now. Which means that they will probably get to hang around for a month. So 18 month it is from here on out (which will probably be just the next few months).

**Actions** 
Perhaps the big news of this past month was your apparent conversation to the shower/bath experience. You went from screaming during shower time to crying during shower time to looking upset during shower time to tolerating shower time to the point, now, where, when Amos is in the shower you crawl into the bathroom and try and open the shower doors so you can crawl in with us. And yesterday, when you were getting a bath you found it so fun that when it was Amos’s turn you repeatedly tried to get back in the tub with him. I think that my other favourite action is how much you and Amos enjoy looking at each other through the green roller tube - using it telescope style, and seeing each others faces at either end. First you did this when it was facilitated by your parents, but now when you see the tube I watch you getting in position to look through it on your own and I have to smile.

While all of these accomplishments, both by you Rilka, and you, Amos, are impressive, as you enter your double digit months, it is worth pointing out that this past month was also a big one for other family members. Just yesterday we celebrated the 10th birthday of your cousin Rose, and the day prior to that your mother submitted her PhD thesis, which she wrote in a truly remarkable three weeks. And, just the day before that your grandfather purchased his first house, in Prescott Arizona, at the age of 73. So many changes and developments all around. It makes me excited to read what I will be writing for your 11 month birthday. Though I plan to deeply enjoy the 31 days between now and then.

Love,
Dad
