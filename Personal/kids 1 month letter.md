# 1 Month Birthday
#writing


Dear Amos and Rilka,

We have transitioned from weeks to months. I am curious to see who you are (and where we are) when  the first year marker arrives. However, I am also curious to see who you are next week, and even tomorrow. You are both changing so quickly. Today I showed you, Rilka, a toy that your Nana had bought for you, and you stared at it intently and then smiled multiple times. This was a first. And I have to note that while you both spend a lot of time looking at me you have not really, at least as of yet, offered me what can be definitively classified as a smile. I’m looking forward to that.

I would like to use your one month birthday as a milestone to step back and take stock.

**Your Stock**
Your growth curves have both been rather impressive. Your heads are increasing in circumference, your limbs are elongating, and your bodies are becoming more substantive. It’s hard to believe that all of this is powered by milk and formula. 

And its not just changes in dimensions. Your necks are getting much stronger. I have been doing little neck workout sessions with both of you each day (which you tolerate with remarkable equanimity), sitting you up by pulling your arms, while you try to pull your head up along with your body. Your vocalizations are becoming more frequent and diverse. Your eyes are starting to follow movements. Your grasp is getting much stronger. And you are spending more time awake, just looking around, taking in the world.

You also are starting to grow apart from each other, or rather, as you develop you are beginning to reveal your differences, as you reveal yourselves. Rilka, you are so expressive. In the course of 60 seconds dozens of expressions can flit across your face. Amos, I love when you wake up. Your routine is like that of an old man, as you stretch your arms high above your head and make grimaces with your face. You are also a very aggressive eater when you are hungry. We have to navigate your impatiently windmilling arms as we try and get a bottle to your mouth after a long sleep has left you craving a meal. Rilka, your power poops, which so far you have saved for me alone, are already the stuff of legend, or at least stories that I relate to your mother. Today you had a great sequence where you did a normal poo, while being changed, which I adroitly caught in the fresh diaper I had just put down. Then while I reached for a wet wipe you blasted me with a poop canon that went all over my bare chest and splashed down to my shorts. I wiped up the poo that had hit the table, careful not to drip any from myself onto the floor, and went to pick up the change pad to put you down so that I could go take a shower. This was when you hit me with another poo blast. It was pretty impressive. How does your tiny body produce such velocity? 

**My Stock**
In some respects, early childhood isn’t really for kids, but for parents. You will remember none of this, and yet for me this is a life changing time. It strikes me as odd that the most intense time a child and parent spend together is only remembered by one party. But perhaps in the way your infancy is a phase you need to pass through in order to become a walking/talking kid, this time is also necessary for us to develop into the parents we want to be for you. There is an aspect in which caring for something helpless develops a bond that would not otherwise exist.

After a month certain aspects of parenting two infants have become second nature. Washing bottles, turning on the electric kettle to heat the water to warm your formula, washing the lids of the formula cans, clicking open the tab on the sports drink bottle we use for the formula, doing all this with one hand while holding one of you, squirming, in the other. Opening the bottle with the free hand and pouring in the formula, or the milk that is up on the ledge that Donna pumped earlier. Changing diapers, putting Penaten on butts, swaddling, dual feeding - one on my legs the other propped up by a rolled up blanket, watching French Netflix shows. 

At times, to be honest, it risks becoming a bit routine, a bit rote. This is a risk that is not realized, however, as you two are definitely neither routine nor rote. Although hopefully in another 2 months you will be routine in at least some aspects, presently, I truly appreciate your dynamic existence, as it means that I am continually looking at you anew, with fresh eyes, and wondering. Wondering what that noise meant, what that expression portended, wondering at how strong you are getting, wondering at the positions you sleep in, and the dreams you must be having, wondering what you see when you look at me, or when you’re staring out from your stroller, wondering whether you are having emotions, wondering where the reflexes end and your personalities start, wondering at your very existence which seems, frankly, impossible. 

And wondering, after my first month of fatherhood, and the only first month I will ever have, what the future holds for you, and for us. Next month, next year, when you are my age some day…

Love,
Dad
