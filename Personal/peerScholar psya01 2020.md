>Although all components were addressed, many were addressed superficially and were not explained well. 

>Your summary of the article touched on all required components however many were addressed superficially and were not explained well - for example when you say the dependent variable is the students, what do you mean? 

>The implementation plan was not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate deep thought.

> A clear summary with well identified independent and dependent variables, theory, hypothesis, and methods.

> Your proposed intervention in Ontario schools made a clear connection to the results of the paper and showed true creativity and thought. Well done. 

> The implementation suggested is very scattered - you would be better off focusing on one specific intervention directly related to the study.

>It was clear that you made an effort in your comments, however many were vague and lacked specific critiques and suggestions.

>It was clear that you made an effort to provide thoughtful comments, however suggestions should prioritize ideas and content over more superficial aspects like sentence structure.
