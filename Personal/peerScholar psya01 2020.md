Comments to peers:

## Final Essay
- identify theory, hypothesis, methods, IV and DV

>Although all components were addressed, many were addressed superficially and were not explained well. 

>Your summary of the article touched on all required components however many were addressed superficially and were not explained well - for example when you say the dependent variable is the students, what do you mean? 

> A clear summary with well identified independent and dependent variables, theory, hypothesis, and methods.

>The implementation plan was not sufficiently detailed to demonstrate deep thought.

> Your proposed intervention in Ontario schools made a clear connection to the results of the paper and showed true creativity and thought. Well done. 

> The implementation suggested is very scattered - you would be better off focusing on one specific intervention directly related to the study.

## Final Reflection
>You said you attempted to []. How did you do this?

>I agree with your peers that [] is not a good approach.

>It was clear that you spent time considering and implementing the suggestions of your peers where deemed appropriate.

> While your reflection showed that you put thought into how to improve your paper, it would have been stronger if you had indicated how you had addressed - or decided not to - each of your peers' feedback.

> There is no indication of which peer suggestions you took or didn't take and why.


## Comments to Peers
>Repetitive, and not detailed enough. 

>Your comments to peers were generally thoughtful and helpful, although in a couple of cases your comments focused a bit narrowly on a single paragraph.

>You did a good job of thoroughly addressing specific issues in your peers papers along with actionable suggestions. Well done.

> You need to provide specific examples of where improvements can be made as well as what those improvements might be.

>It was clear that you made an effort in your comments, however many were vague and lacked specific critiques and suggestions.

>It was clear that you made an effort to provide thoughtful comments, however suggestions should prioritize ideas and content over more superficial aspects like sentence structure.
