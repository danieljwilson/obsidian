# 9 Month Birthday
#writing

Dear Amos and Rilka,

I am sitting at the dining room table, while you, Rilka, play with the Pellegrino bottles on the floor in the kitchen, and you, Amos lie on the floor in the living room, chewing on the Easter card that your Nana gave you. Update. I just took it away from you and replaced it with the wood and elastic toy that was one of our original toy purchases for you. You seemed mildly annoyed.

Your mother, in the kitchen with Rilka, just informed me that she has an “experiment” in the oven. Speaking of ovens and experiments, it has now been exactly nine months since you were both, fairly aggressively, removed from your own proverbial oven. Since that moment you’ve sped 3/4 of the way around the sun, a distance of 112,200,000 km. Plus, by this point, Rilka has probably covered another km in all of her daily peregrinations. For Amos that number might be closer to 10m. Luckily, for you, Amos, it’s not a race. In any case, regardless of distance, this elapsed time means you are almost exactly 1% of the age of your grandparents, who both conclude their 73rd loops this year. It is also your last time in the single month digits. Ever. So keep that in mind over the next 30 days. You will then have 7 years and 7 more months to enjoy your double month digits before you graduate to triple digits. And you’ll have just hit double digit years when we get to celebrate your grandparents’ arrival into the quadruple month digits, July 12, 2030 for your Grandpa, and January 30, 2031 for Nana. It’s strange how far away that seems, given how close 10 years previous, when I had was 32, appears in the rearview.

This birthday falls on Easter Monday, which they call Paques here in France. Kids have two weeks of vacation at this time of year but due to current circumstances, those vacations will likely not be as exciting as originally anticipated. That’s right, we’re under confinement orders at the moment. It’s hard to believe that at your last birthday it still seemed possible that life might not be dramatically disrupted by COVID-19. In fact, the day after your 8 month birthday I went for a long group bike ride, after which I hung out with friends in a coffee shop. Now I bike on a resistance machine on our apartment balcony. To be honest our lives have not been terribly disrupted by the confinement rules, as we were, via our decisions to have kids and then promptly move to a foreign country, already largely successfully socially isolated. And your lives have not been disrupted at all. Your all inclusive vacation package - unlimited food and drink and playtime - continues unabated. Not only that, but now you are getting more grandparent screen time than ever, with daily or bi-daily calls a regular feature of your afternoons.

The main changes to your lives, however, have in fact been internally motivated. As your brains and bodies develop, this rapid growth gives rise to new expressions of self, which we get to watch, and interpret, from the outside. It’s as if a blurry picture is very gradually beginning to come into focus. And part of what I find interesting is the differences between the two images that are emerging, as your expanding abilities also create the possibility for expanded differentiation.

The following is a non-comprehensive list of your abilities, likes and peccadilloes 

#### Amos
**Movement**
Your favourite still seems to be not moving, lying on your back, touching and looking at an interestingly textured item (that seems to be almost all items in your estimation). Often you will slowly rotate the object while starting at it with a focused gaze. I also enjoy when you take a single index finger to slowly stroke the surface.

You do spend a lot more time on your stomach now, however, looking around, but usually, after a certain period of time in this position the weight of your head overcomes the strength of your neck muscles and you lie your head down on your hands and express your displeasure. It is clear that at times you do want to move, and I particularly enjoyed the day when I was tickling you and your response was to execute a log roll away from me. However your main attempt at movement involves a lifting of all limbs as far off the ground as possible. My hypothesis is that this is you trying to replicate getting picked up. You are essentially trying to pick yourself up and move yourself around, and the more of your body you get off the ground the closer you think you are getting to success. This is going to be a disappointing path. And you do love kicking those legs.

**Vocal**
You are much quieter, in general, than your sister, but that is a high bar. That said, you have some moments when you really let it all out. And the laughter remains a constant element. 

**Physical**
Your teeth have finally made an appearance. And your hair, at least in the middle of your head is starting to arrive. 

**Action**
A few neat actions from this past month include:
* tossing your crinkly and bell cube off the 5th floor balcony while set out in your carseat
* taking your sunhat off immediately after it gets put on. Unless we distract your for about 30 seconds at which point it seems like you forget that it is on your head
* you sticking out your hand to either grab me or ford me off when I play “coming to get you” with you
* you still don’t have a good technique for getting from sitting to lying on your back. So you current method is just to lean back. Usually this means we have to catch you so you don’t clonk your head, but, since we can’t watch you all the time sometimes you end up clonking yourself. When you do you get a pained expression on your face but, generally, do not make a sound, other than an initial grunt/groan.

#### Rilka
**Movement**
This month has been an explosion for you. From crawling to pulling yourself up on the couch, and then on us, to moving along the couch - usually toward the toybox, to figuring out how to get back down from a standing position, you’ve been advancing by leaps and bounds. And before we know it I’m sure you will be adding leaping and bounding to your repertoire. You’ve also started to make your first attempts at dancing - which for the moment mainly involves thrusting your hips suggestively and then banging one hand up and down on the nearest available surface.

**Vocal**
There are so many version of noisy Rilka. There is still your heron squawk and fake laugh and raspberries, but now you have added a new popping noise to the mix. This is in addition to your fairly standard baby babbles and shrieks (you love a good shriek) and first attempts at singing, or at lest that is how we are interpreting it.

**Physical**
Your bottom two teeth are looking like real teeth now. Though I am curious why there is the delay for the other teeth to come in - why not all at once? Your hair is developing a bit of a swirl and is a blondish red brown. I’m curious to see the final version of this. Your nasal area alternates between a covering of wet mucousy drool and caked snot and food remnants. You DO NOT like having it wiped clean.

**Actions** 
While your continuing quest for the screens (laptop, tablet, iPhone) lends itself to most of your greatest discoveries (crawling, pulling the couch covering towards you to get things), there have been many other interesting moments. One of my favourites is when you just head off on some independent self exploration. For example, when I found you banging away on the kids tub for the shower we had stowed under the bathroom sink the other day. You have also started to understand the properties of hinges. Both in terms of pages in books as well as the kitchen door, which you were swinging open and shut to reveal and hide yourself a couple of days ago. You are also interested in moving beyond the well trodden paths and have gotten comfortable with going out on the balcony - although the transition to the cold tile from the radiantly heated laminate flooring seems to distress you a bit.

I am so curious to know what a similar list would look like for both of you 30 days from now. The interest comes from the combination of things I can predict and those that will completely surprise me. And while I am looking forward to it I also want to be sure to take my time and watch you. Closely.

Love,
Dad
