#### Assumptions
**Assumptions of Normality**
* required by most parametric tests (which don't?)  
* means that the distribution of the test is normally distributed with 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (does this mean it is normalized? don't think it has to be normalized)

**Assumptions of Homogeneity of Variance**
* variance within each of the populations is equal

**Assumptions of Homogeneity  of  Variance-Covariance  Matrices**   
* the  vector  of  the  dependent  variables  follow  a  multivariate  normal  distribution
* the  variance-covariance matrices are equal across the cells formed by the between-subjects effects (what does this mean?)
