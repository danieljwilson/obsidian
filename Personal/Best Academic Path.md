# Plan

#### Note
- A "year" refers to the typical September-August academic year...
- This plan starts after high school graduation

## Year 1
Take a year off after high school 
- Work half a year
	- Save money
	- Experience the real/non-school world
- Travel half a year
	- Experience a different world
	- Taste of independence
- More than a year starts to create to large a gap when you go back to school, one year is perfect as it makes you slightly interesting and slightly more mature

## Years 2-3
After undergrad do not go directly to graduate school...time for some FUN (and life expanding experience)
- Option 1: an actual fun/unusual [[Jobs|job]], like DJing or working on a yacht in the Mediterranean, or becoming a police officer, or becoming an art handler, or anything that you **definitely** will not be doing once you are in academia.
- Option 2: a job that allows you to do something fun (e.g. art, music, sport, start up business, etc.) This can also be combined with Option 1 if you do something like teaching English in Asia
- Take it seriously (the fun job or fun thing)
- Combine it with travel/foreign country
	- Learn the language in that country

## Years 4-6
Get a real job [three years]
- This can be a series of jobs
- The jobs should pay reasonably well, and ideally will expose you to a "real" business environment. 
	- Bonus: the jobs require development of transferable skills (which many do)
		- [[Quantitative analysis]]
		- [[Programming]]
		- [[Writing]]
		- [[Project management]]
- You can work for government or an NGO but get at least a year at a profit driven company (they can of course still be ethical and/or interesting)
- Ideally this is in a major city (or cities), and ideally one(s) that you might not already know very well. Think New York, Paris, London, LA, Tokyo, etc.
	- Note that for at least part of this time that city should be in a country where you would like to live, or return to often, as you should at this time...
- Live frugally. Have fun occasionally but don't buy into a "comfort" lifestyle. Don't get a car (unless you live in LA), don't eat out a ton, and don't get take out. Don't spend a shit load of money at bars. This is so that you can:
	- Buy a house. It can be shitty and small but do the best you can on the salary you have and get **something**. Not *anything*, but something that you can tolerate and perhaps improve and then can rent out when you are away.
	- Start retirement savings. If someone said you can do 1 unit of work this year or 10 units of work over the course of 10 years, starting 10 years from now, choose the former. Save as much as you can. Get some good [[Investing|investing]] advice. Which is probably just to put everything in a few ETFs. If you can keep saving (even just $100/month) after this really try to do it.
		- For example if you are able to put $30,000 in retirement savings (perhaps your company even provides matching funds) over those three years and then just put in $100/month going forward that alone would provide you with about half a million for [[Retirement|retirement]] at 65 (assuming a modest but reasonable 6% return and a 40 year time horizon...if you waited to retire until 75, then you would have close to a million)
- If you are not American look into the Working Holiday program for permission to work abroad officially.

## Years 7-8
Get a lab manager job [two years]
- This can also be a research assistant position but perhaps harder to swing. Although if you are able to work part time and volunteer as a research assistant then that can make the path easier.
- Year 1: look into labs that you think are interesting
	- Read their papers
	- Look at posters from their lab
	- See if the PI has talks online you can watch (can give you some insight into their personality)
	- See if the PI appears on any podcasts
	- Try to attend a couple of conferences
		- These are disgustingly overpriced but it can give you the chance to see a bunch of the people that you think you are interested in all in one place
	- Think a lot about what you are really interested in, and what you find tedious/boring/useless. Ideally you enjoyed the job you were doing in the last step enough - or it provided you with enough credentials - that you don't see academia as the ONLY PATH at this point.
- Year 2: apply for schools
	- You're still interested in academia? Okay.
	- Do your prep the summer before.
		- GRE study
		- Draft your letter of "intent"
		- Make your list of labs to apply to
			- Make sure you have an idea of the "culture" in that lab. Ideally you want a PI who is organized and driven but also has a strong respect for work/life balance and the welfare of her/his trainees. A bit younger is probably better, in general, but ideally not brand new. Also they should be interested in you pursuing your own interests, and not just looking for someone to plug into their ongoing research projects.
	- Reach out to professors in early August
		- They might be on vacation or at a summer school or something but come September they will be super busy with the beginning of the semester and then a slew of requests will come in from interested graduate students (if they are popular).

## Years 9-13
Graduate school
- Finish on time
- Be involved, but on your own terms
- Have kids after your 3rd year
	- Schools usually provide some funding
	- You're a poor student so you get subsidized day care

## Years 14+
Well you did it. You are about 35 and you have a PhD, are a homeowner, have a kid or two, and have a respectable nest egg for retirement. What next?
- Continue in academia with a post doc
- Go back to your old job
- Use your PhD skills in industry
- Government
