# 1 Year Birthday (+ 28 days)
#writing 

Dear Rilka and Amos,

This is a slightly delayed letter as your birthday fell during a hectic time period this year. But it is an important letter as it has the job of taking stock of your first complete revolution of the sun. You have started repeating days for the first time.

Your 1 year birthday landed on a Monday, this year, which also marked the end of the two weeks of government mandated self-quarantine, which we spent at the swimming pool-less basement apartment of 312 Glenlake Avenue. To kick off this momentous day we went for a 30 minute walk to the closest hospital, St. Joseph's Health Center, where we waiting in line for about 20 minutes to get tested for coronavirus. The procedure was very unpleasant - essentially it involved getting a pipe cleaner jammed way up each of our noses. None of us enjoyed it, although Rilka was most vocal about her non-enjoyment. Which seemed fair, seeing as this was your birthday after all.

Your mother and I had actually started the day a bit earlier, setting our alarm for 4:40am so we could ring in the one year celebration at the correct minutes (4:48 and 4:49am) with your Nana, via a FaceTime video call. It was fairly low-energy to be honest, and we tried to go back to sleep afterwards for another 90 minutes. We made a second attempt at a birthday event, this time with you along with us, by attempting to find a bar to have a drink. This was harder than anticipated and the time was mostly spent walking, followed by quickly drinking a beer and heading back to the apartment in order that I could start my intensive neuroscience summer school on time.

So, overall, to be honest, a bit anticlimactic, as far as birthdays go.

I made some notes about you both at that time but since I am writing this letter almost three weeks late, I will write about who you are now, rather than who you were then. 

Rilka. I can hear you right now in the playroom of the house where I was born and grew up. Your Nana is talking to you about how she is going to take you and Amos outside to play in the wading pool. Now I can see you, wearing a sunhat and diaper, in your mother's arms. She just walked outside with you. It has been a year of expansion, for you. Both physically and mentally. You are big now. You can (and do) reach up to tables and grab things off of them. You are able to open sliding doors. And cupboards. You have powerful lungs. And you have, as of two days ago, started walking on your own. Which is still slightly confusing to witness. It was not that long ago that we were rooting for you to succeed in your efforts to roll from your back to your front. And now you are locomoting on two legs. Usually, while holding something in your hand (first the Rilka heart pillow Nana made you, and then, today, a sunhat). I predict running within the next two weeks.

My mother, your Nana, noted that she thought that you were more cheerful and happier in person than the image she had formed from our video calls while abroad. I don't think that it is necessarily about being in person, but that you genuinely seem to be developing a more positive outlook on the world. You laugh for real now - not just your weird fake laugh, and have a funny nose-crinkle smile.
