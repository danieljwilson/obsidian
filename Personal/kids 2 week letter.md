# 2 Week Birthday
#writing


Dear Amos and Rilka, 

Happy two week birthday. I am actually writing this just before your birthday, this time at 1:42am, on July 27th. Rilka, you are lying on my chest with your eyes wide open after having a hard time falling asleep. You just did a pretty big burp so I am hoping that helps you relax a bit. Well, you just let out a pretty loud scream, so maybe not. I am watching an episode of The Office in the background. Michael is describing unicorns as horses that fly over rainbows with a spike in their head.

Speaking of unicorns, you met your older (and only, at this point) cousin Rose this week. She’s a big fan of horses with spikes in their heads. Along with your aunts Sheilah and Dani. So it’s been a pretty big week. But it’s been big not just in terms of guests and events (your first pizza party was today at Christie Pits park) but in terms of how much you have both changed. 

There are the obvious changes, like the fact that you are both packing on the pounds at a rapid clip. Helen, your doctor, was proud of the 200 g you, Rilka, added over the past seven days, and downright impressed by the 400 g, your brother, Amos, added (essentially 20% of his body weight). If you, Amos, kept up this rate of growth, compounded weekly, you would weigh approximately 35,120kg after one year. I say go for it.

However, it is the more subtle developments that I find most striking. You’re both becoming alert in a way that makes it clear that you are starting to make your first connections to the outside world. Before this, it felt like we were just seeing an external representation of internal desires, feelings, instincts, and reflexes, but now there is a sense of a new mind making its first tentative steps at taking in the world it finds itself occupying. Your eyes seem to have started actually focusing on people and objects. Your hand eye coordination, while still terrible, is starting to improve, and make sense. When its time to feed, Amos, for example, seems to grab at the bottle in excitement. This usually just hits the bottle away from his mouth, but the reaction seems to be a physical manifestation of desire. 

You’re also developing behavioural differentiations that we find ourselves associating with each of you. Amos, for example, you have a habit of crossing your hands on your chest, a bit like a tiny infant corpse, when focussed on guzzling your milk/formula. Rilka, you have the tendency to half open only one eye, pirate-style, when just waking or starting to fall asleep. And your range of expressions, mostly comical, continues to expand.

You have both mastered the art of the diaper change pee. 

Granted, these are small steps, and not really marketable skills, per se, but even so, you do seem like different people from those we met two short weeks ago. And thinking now, about how I want to maintain my memory of you “back then”, makes me aware of how important it also is to remember you now. Happy Birthday.

Love,
Dad
