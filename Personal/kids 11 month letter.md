# 11 Month Birthday
#writing

Dear Amos and Rilka,

Your last of the monthly birthdays before you complete your very first revolution of our solar system’s sun.

For this birthday I have chosen to do a running diary of your day, from wake up to birthday moment.

7am
I walk into your bedroom, having prepared your bottles. I woke up at 6:41am, which is 4 minutes before my alarm was set to go off. You have trained me.

7:01am
I set you, Amos, down, saying bottle, repeatedly to try and sooth him between the moment of lying him back in bottle drinking position and putting the bottle in his hands/mouth. For some reason it is in this particular gap of 1-3 seconds that you and your sister really lose your cool. As the bottle approaches you reach for it, both hands outstretched, like a man overboard trying to grab a life ring.

During this time, you, Rilka, have started to make some sounds of dissatisfaction back in your crib in the bedroom.

7:04am
You are both halfway through your bottles. The speed of consumption is truly remarkable. Especially thinking back to early days when we could spend half an hour trying to get you to drink 50ml.

7:06am
Having completed her bottle, Rilka, first to finish, as usual, drops her bottle to the floor (with an expression that resembles disdain), and gets into crawling position. Ready for the day.

7:08am
I remove the bottle from Amos's grip, as it has been empty for about 30 seconds as he sucks in air. He is not pleased. He does not get into crawling position but remains lying on his back, with a slightly stunned expression on his face.

7:13am
I look back over after having cleaned your bottles and Rilka is standing up against the easy chair pulling clothes off of it and onto the floor. Amos is seated with the box of stacking boxes set in front of him. I don’t know how it got there. You are both at a point where sometimes when we look away and then look back the scene has changed dramatically. I come over and extract the stacking boxes for you, Amos.

7:28am
While typing out this birthday note seated in a chair, Rilka crawls over and pulls herself up on me. Behind her Amos is making lots of grunty grumbling noises as he runs his fingers on the floor padding. It is slightly textured which means it creates, at least in Amos’ estimation, a pretty awesome sound when you run your fingernails along it. Leaning back he sees my shoes and grabs one, but this also puts the rolling tea cart in view. Much more interesting than a shoe. Amos grabs the tea cart by one of its legs and proceeds to bang it against the wall. Which creates, again, in Amos’s opinion, a pretty awesome sound.

7:30am
I am packing up for a trip to the swings, while Rilka has now crawled onto the couch and is playing with the cushions (big cushion fan), as she also watches Amos, who has paused the tea cart wall slams to grab a pickle strainer with the toes on his left foot.

7:32am
Back to the tea cart wall slamming. Rilka is now holding a single page that she managed to rip out of one of the kids books. It is bright pink and says “I have little hands…”. Time to go to the park. As I pick Amos up to get in the carseat he cranes his head to look at the light fixture. You really really love light fixtures, Amos. It reminds me of a friend of mine whose two year old boy loves ceiling fans so much that she made him a ceiling fan costume for halloween.

7:42am
We stop in to a bakery and pick up a baguette and pain au chocolat. The main goal was some sort of birthday tart but the pickings were slim.

7:47am
We go to the Multari bakery that was right next to our first house on Maccarani street, where we are able to pick up a tarte aux fruits rouge. Which also appears to include blueberries.

7:53
We walk along the pedestrian street that leads to Place Massena. As we turned on to the street we passed a couple of guys who looked to be in their 20s, walking in the other direction while carrying a bluetooth speaker that was playing a song that they were singing along to. They had definitely been up all night. On our right we pass Restaurant Joch, full of people with tiny glasses of orange juice. We are passed on our left buy a guy in his 60s wearing matching flowered shoes, shirt, hat and mask.

8:02am
We have arrived at the playground. It is totally empty. I get you both out and sit Amos on the ground and put Rilka into the swing. Rilka seems to enjoy the swinging, based on her smiles. I’d say she is giving it a 7 our of 10.

8:05am
Amos’ turn on the swing. He has a big smile on his face as the swinging commences, and emits a few laughs. Maybe an 8 out of 10 for Amos. I note that Rilka has reached into the stroller and pulled out the pain au chocolat while I have been pushing Amos on the swing. She has managed to take it out of the bag and is now starting to eat it, a concerned look on her face. I take it away from her, also a bit concerned about how drool-logged one side of the pain au chocolat now is, and replace it with a few pieces of baguette. She immediately takes me up on the replacement offer.

8:19am
We are all sitting at the base of a tree where there is some dirt and leaves and twigs, as well as a group of industrious ants. You are oblivious to these elements as you are both very focussed on the baguette chunks you are holding to your mouth. Rilka keeps putting down one of her baguette chunks in the dirt, and then picking it up, staring at it, and then biting it with a look of great purpose on her face. Amos has only one chunk of bread, which he holds in his left hand. He has stopped eating for the moment as a tram has gone by the park and he intently tracks its progress.

8:20am
Rilka is now vigorously rubbing one of her pieces of baguette in the dirt. She then takes a bite.

8:21am
Rilka is on the move. She is crawling away from the tree with one piece of baguette in each hand.

8:22am
Amos has taken a small chunk off of his larger piece of baguette and is holding it up in his right hand and while touching it, thoughtfully, with a single finger from his left. The poking causes the baguette piece to fall. He sits baguetteless in the dirt.
 
8:23am
Amos reaches with both hands for the tree trunk and gives the bark a good touching.

8:28am
Rilka is standing next to a wooden dolphin with large blue springs attaching it to the ground. She is holding herself up on one of its fins, and touching the bolts that connect the fin to the spring with the focus of a building inspector. She continues to eat her baguette in between bolt touchings. Amos is now pushing against the tree, as if to topple it, with one hand.

8:29am
Amos has picked up a small twig and is now hitting the tree with the twig. Update: he is now trying to touch the twig with his left hand while holding it in his right. Update: he has now dropped the twig and is feeling it with his right hand. Update: he has now picked up the twig and is waving it above his head. Update: he has dropped the stick and is once again pushing against the tree with his right hand, as if to topple it.

8:32am
Rilka has left the dolphin and is now crawing toward the swingset - there is an 8 year old kid on the swingset being pushed by his mother. She approaches stealthily. She looks like a cat hunting a bird as she approaches the walking path that separates her from the swingset area.

8:33am
Rilka pauses her progress as an old lady walking along the path stops to say hello to her. Rilka starts crawling toward the lady, who is smiling at her. Update: Rilka has turned away from the lady an crawls a few paces in a different direction. The lady waves at her and walks away.

8:34am
A couple with backpacks and masks walking along the path also spot Rilka, the swingset hunter. They see me and ask whether Rilka is a girl. I confirm. The lady says that Rilka is very “grassieuse” multiple times. This is a common comment for Rilka. This translates as “graceful” but I have a hard time being that is the correct translation.

8:35am
Amos lets out a big yawn. Rilka is on the move again. She is halfway across the walkway in the direction of the swingset. She stops as the kid and mother leave the swing area - the boy on a bike. Rilka turns and starts following, crawling with an intent expression on her face. She even goes into her “high” crawling gear, until her attention is captured by a pine needle. She stops and puts the pine needle in her mouth. She is sitting now and making some squeaking noises. Amos is grumbling, and waving his hands around. Time to go.

8:45am
Amos and Rilka are back in the stroller, we are heading back home.

9:06am
We arrive home and I have to wake up your sleeping mother as I forgot the keys to the apartment. 

9:12am
You are both put down for your first nap of the day. Mild grumbling about this from Rilka, but not for long.

10:02am
Donna heads out on a candle mission which reminds me I need to find the balloons to make the number 11.

10:16am
I go into your room to wake you up as you have been down for an hour. Amos wakes upon my entry but is pretty groggy. Rilka wakes shortly after and pulls her self up into a standing position, holding onto the side of the crib. I set you both in the living room with the stacking boxes.

10:28am
I turn around and see that Rilka has stacked two of the nesting boxes on top of each other. This is a first. Until now it has been all about knocking boxes down. I put a third box on top of the two she has set up. She promptly knocks all three down.

10:36am
Rilka is trying to remove the chair blocking the stairs as she has become a big fan of crawling up stairs in our new apartment. She gives up and starts pushing another chair around the apartment making a pretty loud racket. This is another of her new favourites. Amos is starting to grumble.

10:40am
I give you both early bottles (normally 2nd meal is at 10:45, and starts with food/puree) to have you ready and in a good mood for the big event.

10:46
Rilka finishes her bottle and tosses it away. Then sits up on her own and lets out a serious belch. Amos is just about done with his own bottle. Much to his chagrin. I dial your grandmother on FaceTime. 

10:48/49
Happy Birthday!!!
