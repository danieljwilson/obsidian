### [[DW]]
Am getting well organized for my thesis work.

### [[CI]]
Need to make sure my systems are used and integrated. Right now I am not really checking things. Need to clean up and either move things to a custom table or use things each day.

### [[GMD]]
We spent a bit of time in bed post-practice and I found myself reading some information on second pregnancies from one of the websites we used to consult on a weekly basis when we were pregnant the first time. It made me think back to those times fondly.

### [[IMD]]
I think that I did a better job than before arguing for Donna to focus on the long term important things like the NSERC and coding bootcamp...but still lots of room to improve. Need to keep in mind that I am not trying to **win** the argument or put Donna in a logical trap...

### [[NK]]
It was kind of funny the other day when Rilka got hold of the broom and started trying to sweep...Amos is still up to his chomping down on the spoon tricks. Funny to imagine what is going through his mind...why is that fun?

### [[RT]]
What happens with Matt and Catherine and kids? And how much should I push on them??
