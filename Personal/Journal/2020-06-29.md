Had a pretty incredibly performance in terms of getting home from my ride at 13:59 and then getting showered, changed, some snacks together and out the door and to the train by 14:12 (that left at 14:13 for Menton).

Missed two days last week. Drinking too much. Sleeping too little. In the “the hell with it” stage as the trip winds down. Need to perhaps avoid this stage. Make it an event to mark the end, rather than a continuous relaxing of structure.

I appreciated when I realised that I would be late getting back for my ride and let Donna know and she was generous in terms of taking on more kids work - shuttling them on her own to the train - with what felt like good nature. I could imagine being slightly annoyed, myself, and so when I see someone else in a situation in which they react better than I would have I feel admiration toward them.

We had sex last night but it was kind of uninspired. Need to improve this area.

Amos gave Rilka a look on the train yesterday after she made some sounds and then made a sound back to her in a way that really felt like he was trying to communicate. Also Amos’ squirming has gotten a bit better. And Rilka has good balance but is afraid to walk.

What has Robert’s life been like? Is he happy now? What does he talk to Merine about when they are on their own?
