### [[DW]]
Did a decent job of working all day yesterday.

### [[CI]]
Letting bedtime slip again...need to reel that back in.

### [[GMD]]
I had a sticky data science task to do and was thinking of how to do it when I had to make dinner last night and liked the thought that I had that I could bring it up before dinner and we could discuss how to approach it and that we would both probably find that fun (even though we just watched a stand-up comic instead).

### [[IMD]]
Have not organized our weekly future planning or Gottman stuff. Still just hanging. Need to get to it.

### [[NK]]
Amos' love for the plastic travel cutlery is amazing. Still loves holding onto it for extended periods of time. Cried this morning when it was taken away for him to go to daycare. Rilka seems to know which of the lighter jackets is hers now (the pink one).

### [[RT]]
Will the kids miss the YMCA? How long to adjust to the new setup?
