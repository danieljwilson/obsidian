### [[DW]]
Am doing well with the Algebra course. Found a course/learning technique that works pretty well for me. 

Also, I think that the work I am doing to refocus my thesis is time well spent.

### [[CI]]
Still haven’t made my art and programming schedule. Need to do that.

### [[GMD]]
I like it when it feels like there is a problem to be solved and it feels like we are both working together on it - whether it is together - like picking out the homes on airbnb - or separate - like Donna organising the Toronto doctor’s appointment and then me organising the Nice version with the pediatric endocrinologist.

### [[IMD]]
I think I could do a bit better of a job of checking in with Donna about how her work is going. Saw that she had 6 x’s (denoting thesis time) on Monday. Reinforce that behaviour.

### [[NK]]
I am surprised that the kids like the 6 packs of water bottles so much. There is something about the shape/weight and the squeaking of the plastic that holds them all together that they like. Amos is getting more fussy these days. Not sure how to interpret it but seems related to not being able to move around.

### [[RT]]
How would people react if we really went ahead with the idea of having new kids with 3rd party girl/guy? How would Donna feel? How would the kids feel being “half” kids. Would they be bonded more strongly with one of us?
