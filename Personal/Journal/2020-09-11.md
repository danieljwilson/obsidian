Did a good job of selling extra stuff pretty quickly.

Need to figure out how to connect with Donna more effectively in times like this where we are busy and tired and dealing with stresses.

### [[GMD]]
While this has been a tough time in terms of connecting and communicating with so many outside factors and the logistics of the move that had to be dealt with, I feel like some of our past work is paying off. So, even though this is not a sustainable way to have a good relationship, it feels less fraught than it might have previously as we have started building a more solid foundation (previously). So we can lean on this a bit during times like this. Which feels nice. Though I also think that I want to become better at managing chaotic stressful times that break my routines.
