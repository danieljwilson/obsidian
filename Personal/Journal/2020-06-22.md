### [[DW]]
Did all my diary days last week. Slept in this morning. Cut the ride short when I just wasn’t feeling good.

### [[CI]]
Sleep.

### [[GMD]]
Yesterday breakfast in bed with the kids as facilitated by Donna was really good. I appreciated that she got the kids dressed up, and got a unique element (fresh juice) along with the classic pain au chocolate. Also I appreciated her sense of “no big deal” for getting the bed full of croissant crumbs. Because once in a while it is worth the cost to have the kids acting funny/silly even if it does create work. And then, in addition, she handled that work herself (washing the sheets) without complaint. 

### [[IMD]]
Just this morning I got short with Donna as I find her hemming/hawwing annoying when I have a specific question and she goes back and tries to think about adjacent things. I just need to be specific about what I want an answer to.

### [[NK]]
Rilka has started enjoying putting things in boxes. She has a box full of items right now. Amos seems to JUST be beginning to think about trying to move on his stomach. But feels like he could regress if not encouraged/pushed. 

### [[RT]]
Does Amos need help strengthening his body? Is that part of the problem? He does seem a bit floppy? Was I weak as a kid? I remember not being able to do a pull up? Did I have low testosterone?
