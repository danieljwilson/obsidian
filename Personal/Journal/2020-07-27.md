Was friendly and personable with Donna's family at the birthday party.

### [[CI]]
Would have been good to have some sort of defined dinner schedule where i was responsible for making dinner for everyone. Should do this in NS perhaps.

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed our time in the pool yesterday. It was pretty low key but just fun to be in with the two kids and switching back and forth with them and seeing them really taking to the water.

### [[IMD]]
We have an ongoing sore spot about time estimates and the fact that I am optimistic, in general, in my estimates. I need to figure out how to defuse earlier. I don't really care what her estimate is and so if we agree on a departure time, for example, it generally doesn't really matter if we think we will arrive somewhere at different times.

Amos is so good at self-entertaining. Probably connected to all the time he hasn't been able to move around and has had to make do with things in his vicinity.

### [[RT]]
Interesting how I had such good legs for the ride yesterday. Curious what that was about? Extra sleep the night before?
