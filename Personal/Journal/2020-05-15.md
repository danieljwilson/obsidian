I just did a pretty effective and efficient shopping trip.

There is too much time creep when I am going out with the kids. Need to stop frittering time pre-walk.

Overall I would give the future planning meeting with Donna last night a thumbs up. She seemed engaged and open and that made the whole interaction feel more productive and fun. I also think that it may have helped that she did more talking, at least at the beginning, to clearly outline where she was and what her “ask” was in terms of using the time. Made me hope that we can keep building momentum on this front (i.e. supporting each others future plans). 

### [[IMD]]
I think that I am too susceptible to letting special things with Donna slide and just doing them pretty last minute. The thing is that I am pretty good at that so the outcome is usually positive. However, in some respects it can actually take more time than planning in advance. And the outcome is usually slightly compromised. A mixture of both types of planning would be best.

I liked today when Rilka did her own face plant into the pillow after I did a “crash landing” into the pillows. Also Amos was having fun rocking back and forth in his carseat to the point where he actually exited it on his own. And was sitting up upon exit.

I wonder how Donna thinks about her current shape? And her goal shape?
