### [[DW]]
Helped Donna out when the kids were being particularly fussy this morning.

### [[CI]]
I get annoyed when Donna is on and the kids are crying a lot. I feel like she could do a better job and that if it were me I would be doing a better job. Probably not a great attitude. Either I need to put my finger on what the difference is and ask her to "do" that, or else let it drop.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciated when Donna on her own (before my garbage alarm went off at 9pm) went about organizing and taking out all of the garbage.

### [[IMD]]
Need to get Donna more involved in the Mezzanine. Can be good to use the energy of a partner to keep projects moving.

### [[NK]]
Interesting how these last couple of days Rilka has been very fussy in the morning but seems to cheer up when she gets her snowsuit on (except for her mittens which she doesn't like). Both are so snotty that they have a constant but also constantly shifting fused mass off dried snot at the end of their nose.

### [[RT]]
How is Jeff doing? Is he happy? What is life like in his family/household??
