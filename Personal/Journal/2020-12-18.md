### [[DW]]
Got on a good roll last night with working and making some progress on thesis work.

### [[CI]]
Mornings are not going all that smoothly. Partly due to fatigue. Partly due to not enough planning. Need to also put the things I write here that I want to come back to in a list somewhere.

### [[GMD]]
I just spent a few minutes running around the house with Rilka on my shoulders and Amos on Donnas and I think all 4 of us had a pretty good time.

### [[IMD]]
Had a tone/annoyance moment with Donna yesterday when I came upstairs and Rilka had not been taken out of her snow stuff while I had been dealing with Amos. I just feel like Donna dawdles/is lazy at times and I think it was playing into that larger internal narrative.

### [[NK]]
It's kind of impressive that they are experiencing weather that is almost 20 degrees colder than anything they have previously seen. They don't seem to be making much progress these days due to their overarching fussiness.

### [[RT]]
Do they have baby clothes with temperature sensors (e.g. socks) so you can tell whether your kid might be complaining due to the cold?
