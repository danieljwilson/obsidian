Had an efficient call with Roger and got my morning stuff done - keeping up with the summer school

### [[CI]]
Need to focus on the practicalities of the group project for nma.

I enjoyed the call with Roger yesterday. It felt like he was a good mediator in our decision making processes, and that is in large part because we have both "bought in" and are making genuine effort to improve our communication abilities under his tutelage.

Should spend some evening just hanging non-productive time with her each day.

Rilka when she holds out one of her arms and shakes it, like a wave kind of, but from the shoulder. Amos' continuing appreciation of the spatula.

What would working for Vice be like at this point. I feel some concern about getting back into the swing of things, editing-wise, but I am sure it would be fine after a week or so. But how to think about my time? It seems like if I take this I should use it to buy a house but will it actually put me in position to do that??
