Put together the family Notion.

### [[CI]]
I should do more cooking projects when home with mom. Try and make mini special events. Don't wait just for grand gestures.

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed when Donna came out of the shower after running in her new black dress from MEC - it was a simple moment but contained a lot of things I find attractive about Donna - her mix of practicality and style, her effort to look good as part of an effort to mark a special moment/evening, and just her good looks.

### [[IMD]]
I was again, a bit short with Donna when dealing with the housing stuff. I really need to keep some remove from my emotions that get annoyed so easily. I felt like I wanted her to be more invested in it and interpreted her behavior as too blase.

Rilka is sitting next to me on a stool like a big kid, eating a big chunk of bread. Amos is sitting on the floor with Rita, reading a book with her. She has just pointed out how much they seem to have grown up in the past month. It is true - it does seem like things are accelerating.

### [[RT]]
What is/will be my cycling peak? Has it happened (most likely) already? Am I going to train hard this next winter?
