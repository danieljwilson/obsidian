Let myself get better before going back to training.

### [[CI]]
When things like making the shelves are on the back burner and there isn't an obvious time to actually "do" it I just kind of let the task slide. Instead I should just arrange a time and that's that.

On a similar note we should set a day/schedule for vacuuming and mopping the apartment, changing the linens, cleaning the bathroom, etc.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciate how Donna has kept up with her daily 5 appreciations. It definitely feels good to read them each morning and also puts me in a state of mind that is more receptive to focusing on the positive aspects of our relationship.
