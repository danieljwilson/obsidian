Did a decent job prepping for my lab meeting and did a decent job of managing it with Cendri pretty absent.

### [[CI]]
Just need to spend more time in outreach. People have thought of this stuff before. Check in with them. See where the new ground lies...

### [[GMD]]
I enjoy my "lobby" moments when I am on break and go over and (sometimes) torment Donna - I appreciate that she is (mostly) game for a bit of goofing around in the middle of the day.

### [[IMD]]
I think that I need to be clearer about some of my policies - like time of picking up the kids - just so there isn't weird feelings that linger.

### [[NK]]
I like reading about the kids at daycare. Seems like Rilka is doing really well - today the description was that Rilka was walking around crunching leaves with her feet and Amos was sitting in the wagon laughing and enjoying her activities...

### [[RT]]
How do David and Julia feel about the dinner party? Are they thinking of having a kid??
