Finally pulled the trigger on a desk and rented the car and am just getting it all done this morning.

I have a hard time getting myself to make small progress. I think that I need some sort of system where I can essentially press a button and I am all ready to work on a project. Opening up a jupyter lab notebook and the relevant web pages is enough friction to make me opt out at times.

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed reading the review of l'Avventura with Donna. I felt like we were both kind of nonplussed by the movie but then both (I think) reevaluated things a bit after reading the thoughtful essay by Roger Ebert. That was nice.

Rilka was pretty whiny and crying this morning but then somewhat cheered up when we got dressed for school and she got to walk a bit outside. It was -17 when we started the walk to school. The coldest temperature these guys have experienced in their lives!

Are the kids mitts too big? Is there not a mitt that would be "great"?
