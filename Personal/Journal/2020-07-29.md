Did a good job on the neuromatch group project. Did a some analysis that made sense and helped me learn/solidify some concepts.

### [[CI]]
Probably shouldn't have taken so long to do this. I can easily get caught up wanting to make a nice visualization when that time might be better spent moving the analysis itself forward.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciate the fact that Donna has been pretty on the ball about organizing the furniture moving stuff. I think that my default would have been just to get rid of everything, but for the cost of storage we still have that option and now also can almost completely furnish a new apartment if/when we get one. I appreciate it when I am pushed/helped into the better choice through someone else's effort - especially when I am feeling low energy.
