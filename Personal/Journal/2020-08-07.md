Had a good call with Yoel and then followed up promptly with he, Cendri and Mickey.

### [[CI]]
Need to be a bit more engaged with the kids when I am on.

### [[GMD]]
Last night Donna was going to bed and then came back to suggest some sexual escapades. That was nice.

### [[IMD]]
I think that I need to be careful in my tone with Donna as we approach some fairly big decisions about buying property etc. Keep calm, keep a step back from emotions, and think about where she is coming from.

Amos right now is talking to himself and playing with a figurine while sitting on the floor. Earlier today he repeated his plastic pumpkin face mask trick with a jar lid which was pretty great. Rilka is doing a good job of amusing herself with her own jar lid placing on fence activity. Now she just crawled behind the stove and is cruising along the couch. Today she took a few tentative steps on her own, after doing the same outside yesterday.

### [[RT]]
When is Amos going to walk? Seems like it could be six months from now?!
