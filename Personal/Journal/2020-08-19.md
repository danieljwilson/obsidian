### [[DW]]
Did some fast and, I think, effective research into the housing situation in Montreal. Seems like it could be a good solution and also is aligned with Donna's interests too.

### [[CI]]
I need to think more about big picture. Like, how do mortgages work in other places. What are the affordances of other places? How many places to do?
- Summer = Toronto + MTL
- Fall = NYC
- Winter = South/France/Costa Rica

### [[GMD]]
I got a kick out of signing the offer paperwork last night on one apartment in Toronto with Donna while also finding an apartment that we were both excited about in Montreal.

### [[IMD]]
I think that I could be more knowledgeable about the pregnancy stuff. I should know the days and kind of be more "in it" with Donna.

### [[NK]]
Amos just started eating a nectarine like a grown up a moment ago. He picked it up and just bit into it. Rilka is doing really big poops because she is eating so much. We are getting pretty close to 50lbs of kids.

### [[RT]]
What will Rilka and Amos' body types be like down the road? Right now Amos seems more flexible, floppier, and longer/leaner.
