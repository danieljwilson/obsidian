### [[DW]]
Had a more productive evening work session. It was good just going through the `follow up` inbox and knocking things off.

### [[CI]]
I need to do more research on home owning in order to feel good about our choice.

### [[GMD]]
It was a nice moment last night sitting at the dinner table with the meal that Donna had made and salads my mother had made and just having a good relaxed dinner.

### [[IMD]]
I think that I can be better about following up on Donna's Slack messages. Need to model the behavior I want. This also includes talking with my mouth open and pushing things on my plate with my fingers, etc.

### [[NK]]
I like how Rilka is chowing down on the Annadamma bread. She puts her arms above her head reaching for the pieces as my mother gives them to her (and Amos) like a little bird. Amos does the same but to a lesser degree. 

### [[RT]]
I'm curious how the kids would be if they had parents that treated them like my mother does this whole time. Or had interactions at a daycare from early months.
