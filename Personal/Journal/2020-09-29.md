### [[DW]]
Got Donna her new shoes and on time for her thesis defense. Was minorly proud of that.

### [[CI]]
Still fairly last minute off the cuff. I think that people like knowing that you did something that required you thinking about them well before you "had" too...

### [[GMD]]
Just got back from a lunch at Planta with Donna. I think that we are both tired and have lots still on our plates but it felt really nice to be part of Donna's checking off one of the big items off of her list. Makes me excited about the future.

### [[IMD]]
I should have been more supportive leading into the thesis defense.

### [[NK]]
Last night I spent some time chasing the kids around the island in the kitchen (and letting them chase me) and they were both losing their minds with laughter. Really fun.

### [[RT]]
Amos seems like he is developing quite slowly. I tell myself that humans develop slower than other animals and are smarter, so a human that develops more slowly must also be smarter than a regular developing human but that seems like only possibly true and definitely not always or necessarily...I hope he is good...They both seem to have a level of engagement/understanding that is rapidly growing.
