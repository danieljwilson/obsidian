### [[DW]]
Got started on grading and did a decent job of prepping.

### [[CI]]
The short sleep night on the weekend has had lasting effects. Monday was a complete wash and yesterday was mostly a wash. 

### [[GMD]]
I appreciate that Donna comes by to say goodnight before I go to sleep in the evenings.

### [[IMD]]
I get too annoyed when Donna is on a call and I speak to her and she does not respond. I would do the same.

### [[NK]]
Rilka really really loves the talking bear now. She starts bobbing her head when the songs start. Amos seems into it as well, just not to the same degree. Amos remains fascinated by the bike. Is it because he has seen me on it? Is it just the mechanical nature of it?

### [[RT]]
Is Amos going to have any lasting feet issues? Will his feet always be small?
