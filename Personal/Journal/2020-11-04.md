### [[DW]]
When something happens with Donna that I find frustrating I am getting better at thinking about how to phrase it in a weekly email as opposed to just being annoyed in the moment.

### [[CI]]
A bit more of a regular morning routine with the kids. I wish the weather were nice and then there could be a park every morning before daycare. But think of a regular sequence that they can rely on.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciate our dinner times. When there is a silly moment on the show that we both connect to and are tickled by. 

### [[IMD]]
Not interrupting when she is working. Put questions in queue perhaps...

### [[NK]]
Amos is so into wiping surfaces. Curious if he is trying to imitate? And Rilka eating with two spoons this morning and actually not doing a terrible job...

### [[RT]]
Sometimes I look at Amos and wonder whether he is a bit slow...fuck I really truly hope not.
