Got all of the “stuff” on the shopping trip yesterday and got home just about on time. Did not get annoyed about the train being later than indicated on google maps.

I can work to try and be faster about my ynab entry turnaround and strava entry turnaround.

I’m thinking back to this past weekend on Saturday when I got back home from taking the kids to the park and seeing the house all tidied up and the new pool in the back patio and it just felt good to me - like there was some good energy momentum that I wanted to build on.

I am working on not judging how Donna spends her days. But not always super successful in that regard. I get annoyed when I hear about days like yesterday where she didn’t start working until the evening but then is “on a roll” right at dinner.

Rilka standing is really fun. Feels like a miracle still. And her reaction of excitement is so nice. She is also going down the stairs backwards right now which is pretty impressive since we didn’t really do much in the way of teaching that. Then she gave her thumbs a few sucks. And then back to the business at hand which involves looking out the window onto the patio while holding her blue pants with white polka dots in one hand.

Did Harlan book a place in Vence partly because of me being in Nice now? And is he hoping that I am there then? Was kind of surprised by that news...
