Have a decent routine of feeding the kids in the morning shifts then setting them up with a cornucopia of toys and then doing a bit of my own work that I would have done when they were napping in order to buy myself some napping time.

My sleep is a mess. Need to come up with a strategy.

It is a regular occurrence but I think I appreciated it more today due to the fasting but I like how Donna comes back from her runs with a fresh baguette and pain au chocolate. Just a pleasant routine. And combined with something that she likes to do.

I think that my reaction just now when she had the email saying we missed our cardiologist appointment was slightly off. I should have been more of a listener, and heard her fear/concern. Instead I was slightly rude and expressed annoyance.

Amos was just making a bunch of clicking noises and then Rilka who was in the bathroom started kind of mirroring him. Then he laughed and then she laughed. It looks like they are engaging directly and purposely which is pretty neat.

Does mom ever sell the house? And how much money do Sheilah and Dani have?
