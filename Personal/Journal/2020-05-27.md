I am getting close to finishing the algebra course. I did a good job in both sticking with it and also finding something that was at the appropriate level. I can tell when doing other things that require algebra that I am on a better level now.

I could probably do to spend a little more time working with Amos on his body coordination.

I kind of like when I am working and come out on a break and see that Donna has made a kind of “baby nest” in some location with the kids. Today it was in the kitchen and Amos and Rilka were both on the floor with her. I appreciate that they are getting a different parenting experience, in some respects, from her. I also enjoyed her sharing her excitement about the progress with the Deloitte app. 

### [[IMD]]
I don’t know if there is a way to help Donna get back on track. I feel like she deserves a bit of slack but I also feel like she has returned to day-frittering mode.

Rilka is sucking her thumb a lot more than before. Has developed over the last few weeks from an occasional thing mainly associated with sleep to a very common thing that she does even when not tired. Amos’s bottom teeth are distinctly crooked. Might ruin the handsome look he had going on.

What would Nice have looked like, as an experience, had we made a really strong push to develop relationships/friendships while here?
