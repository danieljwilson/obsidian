### [[DW]]
Overall I think that my presentation of my thesis work was decent. And I am starting to feel a bit of momentum with my thesis work more generally - even though it is really just starting.

### [[CI]]
Sleep. Need to sleep more. The end.

### [[GMD]]
I feel like due to our business we have let talking about the future kind of fall off the table. But I was thinking recently about how much I am looking forward to restarting the future thinking and starting to organize things like the terrace (or extra floor?) for the MTL apartment, the xmas time period, our time in France, our China year, Donna's bootcamp logistics, etc.

### [[IMD]]
I think that we should restart the Gottmann series and also organize a meeting with Roger and also start doing quotes before watching TV evenings.

### [[NK]]
I will miss when the kids don't wake up like miniature drug addicts desperately needing their fix complete with shaking hands as they reach for their bottles.

### [[RT]]
How long will it take to get paid back for the extra money I am putting into the apartment in Montreal? 

If I take the childcare (5800) and the extra CCB (maybe 6-7000) perhaps not too long?
