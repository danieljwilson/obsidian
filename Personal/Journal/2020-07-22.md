### [[DW]]
Yesterday morning I did my stretching, typing and journaling. Have been skipping that for a few days.

### [[CI]]
My fitness regime is really suffering. Perhaps some treadmill today?

### [[GMD]]
There was something about the pre-kid-bedtime moment last night that I enjoyed. Donna was laying on the couch and the two kids were crawling on top of her. Just underlined how much work she has been doing to help out these last days, and also how connected the kids and her are.

### [[IMD]]
I need to figure out how to add some intimacy back to life with Donna. 

### [[NK]]
I like how Amos is really trying to pull himself up now - even though he seems loathe to use his legs to do so. Seems like a lot of progress for him in the past week. And just makes me happy that he can move around now.

### [[RT]]
Curious what the experience is like for Mike and Ev to have us here. And how they interpret Donna and I's relationship and what they think of the kids (comparatively)...
