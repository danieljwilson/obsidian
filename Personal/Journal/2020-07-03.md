### [[DW]]
Have been doing an overall decent job of looking after the kids all day and still getting a few things done.  

### [[CI]]
Just need to make sure to get my schedule set up tomorrow. Put my bike together today.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciated how Donna tries to pitch in even when I am covering her shifts - playing with the kids at times, and making meals. Makes it easier, and I think there is something about having something that is hard be made just a “tiny” bit easier that we value. 

### [[IMD]]
When talking about programming I still act a bit like a know it all. Probably because I am sensitive to coming across as not knowing very much. Need to feel confident enough in myself not to have to “show” people who I am. 

### [[NK]]
Amos is more mobile now than before, which is fun. It means that sometimes I look over and he is significantly further away/in a different location than before. Rilka is still very fussy, but perhaps a bit of an improvement. Curious if she is feeling out of sorts, or it is just a phase, or if there is some relation to the travel. 

### [[RT]]
Curious how my friends/acquaintances would react to me going on a bike ride while technically under quarantine, or taking the kids for a walk.
