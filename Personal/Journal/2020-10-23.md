Did some work on DSSG. I think that I am on a good path.

### [[CI]]
The fuck it attitude I can take in terms of sleeping and drinking seems potentially problematic. I think that part of the issue is the pleasure I take from a good "reset".

### [[GMD]]
I find it kind of charming how genuinely excited Donna can get about getting given new running clothes.

### [[IMD]]
I should try and be a bit more on the ball when Donna has an "ask" like to use the office today for a call.

### [[NK]]
We looked at photos of the kids from early days in Paris last year and Rilka looks so much like a troll it is kind of startling...today before Amos went to daycare he was out crawling in the hallway by the elevators and just laughing his head off...

### [[RT]]
What will life with Jules really be like? What will be his impression when we actually meet on Monday?
