### [[DW]]
Got back on schedule today and did the things on my list. Getting those flywheels moving again. And didn't try to do a big push on the paper. Just move through it with the hours I have scheduled. But stick to the schedule.

### [[CI]]
Keep the screen up with what I should be doing when. Figure out how to better fit in the daily tasks.

### [[GMD]]
It felt good today when Donna declared that she was really close to being finished. I feel like for both of us it will open up a nice space once it is complete!

### [[IMD]]
My tone today when Donna was about to go for a run and the kids were fussing and she was trying to help out but I didn't want her help - I wanted to let the kids fuss for a minute - was not good. Too annoyed and dismissive. Need to be better at expressing my needs.

### [[NK]]
Rilka was walking for real today after some initial jaunts - always holding onto something. It's neat to see. Amos is looking a bit skinnier. Vacillating between what he wants to eat and not. Still very very attached to the bottle.

### [[RT]]
Curious about Mickey Inzlicht's net value? And Cendri's?
