### [[DW]]
Have been watching the 6h news each day.

### [[CI]]
It's sleep. Again. I am shortchanging myself.

### [[GMD]]
I thought that we had a decent conversation about our plans for the winter. Although there is definitely room for improvement, and moments I found somewhat frustrating, I think it is worth not just comparing our discussion to the platonic ideal but also to the conversation we might have had 2 years ago and appreciate how we have improved.

### [[IMD]]
I don't like when I stop doing these and stop sending the GMDs to Donna. Perhaps at a minimum I should do that, even if I don't do the rest of my tasks.

### [[NK]]
Amos is really impatient. This feels like an extension of his yelling as soon as you took away the bottle when he was just a month old. Now it involves him deciding he wants to move around when you are cutting his nails, for example. Rilka and Amos have very different feet. Rilka's are kind of thick and normally sized and Amos' are very small - perhaps related to his genitals?? - and delicate.

### [[RT]]
Do we end up spending time abroad this spring? If so where? Should we make the push for Nice still?
