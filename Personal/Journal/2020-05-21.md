I did a good job of finding bike workouts, doing a bit of an end around to get access to the precise info for the trainer road workouts. Also did a good job getting in touch with Paul right away after deconfinement.

I think that I could perhaps be more helpful in getting mom going on the Christmas plans. I can imagine her spinning a bit in circles.

I appreciated yesterday when Donna took the couch for her meditation while I was sleeping. I’m not sure why I have become so sensitive to disruption during my sleep but these types of gestures are really appreciated. 

### [[IMD]]
I had a bit of a poor reaction when Donna said that she wanted the kids to have their diapers taken off right away in the morning. I feel like 5 minutes after 12 hours makes no difference, but it also doesn’t really make a difference to me and it does to her. So it makes sense to just do that going forward without comment/complaint.

Rilka’s tendency to put things in her hands and walk around (crawl) with them is in full effect this morning. She has a couple of pieces of cardboard from Donna’s keyboard box that she is walking over to the bathroom with atm.

What the hell are we going to do in September?? Really would like to get some clarity on this. Perhaps time for another powwow this weekend. Also think that going to NS for July makes more sense than for August.
