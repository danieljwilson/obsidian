Doing a decent job of engaging with Jules but also working on my own stuff when the time comes.

### [[CI]]
I am giving myself a pass since I was still sick and out of it yesterday.

### [[GMD]]
I thought our call with Roger was good. I felt like Donna was engaged and proactive and it felt nice to talk to her in some depth and made me look forward to having some more time together.

### [[IMD]]
I am still getting short with Donna at times. I blame it on fatigue but I also have to blame it on me.

As soon as Amos saw the trike the family got him for Christmas he made a beeline for it. Rilka has also been enjoying it. Funny to  see how they interact with it. Rilka seeming to prefer to push it backwards from the front.

### [[RT]]
Kids still crying going into daycare this second week. I think part of it is the drop off scenario but I also think part of it must be the experience. I'm a bit sad that they haven't connected more closely with the staff.
