### [[DW]]
Didn't drink all last week until Friday.

### [[CI]]
I think that I had a bit too much while at Daves. Went over having already drunk, so felt like I was not starting from the same baseline as everyone else.

### [[GMD]]
I was drunker than I would have liked to be but I enjoyed the conversation we had on Friday night when we discussed the options that Donna is considering for her next step. It still feels like small steps forward in terms of our ability to have productive versions of these conversations but there is no question that progress is being made which is nice.

### [[IMD]]
I think that it could be helpful if I actually spent a bit more time working with Donna on her plans and not just providing off the cuff thoughts/ideas. Actually think things through and play them out. Financially, time wise, location wise, etc.

### [[NK]]
I really liked how cool the kids were with Alex Lazarowich yesterday. A lot of that was just how comfortable she was with them, but I appreciated that they could pick up on that and felt unshy around her.

### [[RT]]
How close are we to renting our place in Toronto? And how much would we make if we rented it short term while we were away?
