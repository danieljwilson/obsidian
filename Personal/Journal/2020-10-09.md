### [[DW]]
Have been decent about being proactive about thinking about different scenarios for the Montreal property.

### [[CI]]
Not using my breaks very well at the moment. Just lying down and not sleeping mainly.

### [[GMD]]
I thought Donna and I had a decent conversation about the path forward with the Montreal apartment. Was fun to try and come up with creative ideas/alternatives with her.

### [[IMD]]
I think that it would be good to do a better job about articulating what "jobs" we are going to take on, and then have that clearly delegated and not decided based on factors like fatigue/mood.

### [[NK]]
Amos has this thing right now where he likes to look at me then laugh and hide his face in Donna's leg/shoulder. Rilka is developing some real substantial thighs. I think they get fed quite a bit at school...

### [[RT]]
Curious about the kids' days at daycare. How do they interact with the other kids? How quickly are they "learning"? Is it a richer experience for them than what they are getting at home?
