### [[DW]]
It was a good change to give myself some time in the morning for my routine.

### [[CI]]
I think that I am pushing a bit hard. Makes it too easy to alter the schedule. Need a bit more time in the mornings and need a bit longer for lunch I think.

### [[GMD]]
I enjoy the moments when we are playing with the kids and they are just totally cracking up and Donna and I are able to catch each others' eye with a look indicating something like "yes, this is pretty good". 

### [[IMD]]
We did not spend any time discussing the future and I feel like I am getting a bit annoyed with her non-help with renting the apartment. Perhaps as soon as she submits her boot camp application I should bring this up.

### [[NK]]
Amos is finally starting to pull himself up which is neat. He also did some really good splashing in the tub last night. Rilka has kind of figured out pushing the ball back and forth. Amos also seems to enjoy playing a version of hide and seek where he looks at me, laughs, and hides his head in Donna's lap. Then looks back to catch my eye again.

### [[RT]]
How much does Alex make? What are his finances looking like? How early would he technically be able to retire?
