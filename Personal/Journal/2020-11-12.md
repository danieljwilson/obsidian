### [[DW]]
Did a good job of making my way through the measures spreadsheet.

### [[CI]]
Was getting really tired. Need to either get more sleep or develop a schedule that matches my energy better so that it doesn't feel like I am often "cheating".

### [[GMD]]
I appreciate that Donna puts up with and even plays along with my goof-around moods that sometimes arise. I am used to her reaction now but it is definitely not the only reaction. And because I find it so fun it would definitely be a bummer if the other party did not...

### [[IMD]]
Did not do a Gottman moment with her last night.

### [[NK]]
Rilka is getting a bit needy, especially when tired. I feel torn because it makes me feel good that she "wants" me but it also makes me feel a bit bad for Donna and also I feel torn about how responsive to the complaints I should be. However, even when they are really tired they both seem to get very engaged in the giant logo play when I play along with them.

### [[RT]]
How does Cendri actually feel about my project and progress?
