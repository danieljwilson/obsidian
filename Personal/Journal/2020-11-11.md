Updated stuff in Obsidian.

### [[CI]]
Need to take a look at things. And decide if I am going to use it going forward??

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed when Donna, quite seriously, pointed out that she actually liked the song A Little Bit Alexis - and that she felt that it actually had a good message and she could imagine having fun dancing to it in a dance club/place. All of that made me smile for different reasons.

### [[IMD]]
I need to think of a good way to approach the future stuff and dreams and goals. It ends up triggering Donna and then I get annoyed because instead of getting excited about the future we end up stuck in her past ruminations.

### [[NK]]
I felt a bit of parental pride when the childcare person taking Amos in at the door today referred to him as "Handsome". Funny how we feel our kids success/failure. Also when dropping off and they started going through the COVID checklist Rilka immediately started shaking her head no. Love that.

### [[RT]]
How much do we end up renting 1 Yorkville for? And how big a hassle is it??
