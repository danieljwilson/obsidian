Have gotten back on with the daily diary entries (on normal days). Also committed to restarting my standard schedule.

### [[CI]]
Mornings are a bit lax in terms of being on the ball with wake up routine.

### [[GMD]]
I really appreciated the effort and thought Donna put into our Halloween night. Made me realize again how nice it can be to make efforts with each other that are hors norme of our relationship, and to think about how because something is good doesn't mean it shouldn't couldn't be better. In makes sense not just to focus on the areas that are causing negative outcomes but the areas in which a bit of effort could move an acceptable outcome into a really good outcome. 

### [[IMD]]
When Donna came back from Tara and Bruce's I should have just been asking her about her experience and how she was doing instead I let myself get annoyed about something which knocked her into a bad mood.

### [[NK]]
Amos is cruising. Rilka is just starting to transition to running.

### [[RT]]
Are we going to find a subsidized daycare in Montreal? And what about a new place in Toronto when we want to return??
