Finished up the cabinet in the bathroom.

### [[CI]]
Morning routine is still a bit lackadaisical 

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed our time on the couch yesterday holding the two sick kids and watching mediocre stand up comedy.

### [[IMD]]
I don't remember the specific moment but I can remember having a thought yesterday that I was kind "doing" the dismissive annoyed tone, that Donna had actually brought up in the previous weeks +- note.

### [[NK]]
It's not really "neat", per se, but it is interesting seeing how the kids succumb to their sickness. Just becoming floppy and (in Rilka's case) easily irritable. I am looking forward to them being back in business.

### [[RT]]
Just honestly wondering if we should send the kids to daycare or not today...
