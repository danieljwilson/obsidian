I have been keeping my (week) daily journal now for months.

I’ve reestablished my relationship with Philip

### [[CI]]
I need to still work on my French. I have over a month to improve. That is not an insignificant amount of time.

### [[GMD]]
I kind of like when I am working and come out on a break and see that Donna has made a kind of “baby nest” in some location with the kids. Today it was in the kitchen and Amos and Rilka were both on the floor with her. I appreciate that they are getting a different parenting experience, in some respects, from her. I also enjoyed her sharing her excitement about the progress with the Deloitte app. 

### [[IMD]]
I don’t know if there is a way to help Donna get back on track. I feel like she deserves a bit of slack but I also feel like she has returned to day-frittering mode.

### [[NK]]
Rilka is sucking her thumb a lot more than before. Has developed over the last few weeks from an occasional thing mainly associated with sleep to a very common thing that she does even when not tired. Amos’s bottom teeth are distinctly crooked. Might ruin the handsome look he had going on. 

 ### [[RT]]
What would Nice have looked like, as an experience, had we made a really strong push to develop relationships/friendships while here?
