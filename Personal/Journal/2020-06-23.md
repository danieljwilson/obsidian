I thought we did a good job of de-escalating a situation that had become a bit tense yesterday regarding booking the bassinets for our flight home. We explained what we were feeling and it felt like we both listened to each other, and although the process felt a bit artificial on some levels, it definitely felt like we came away from it in a better spot than we would have in the past.

I think that I can get to telling Donna how she is making me feel or how her comment is coming off a bit sooner in the conversation process.

This morning Amos seemed like he was trying a bit harder to crawl. Rilka and Amos played with opening and closing the bathroom door and laughing. Rilka doing the opening and closing. Rilka also has started to enjoy throwing things into the bathtub.

Curious if there are going to be any side effects from very long term/high usage of AirPods.
