### [[DW]]
I think that it was smart to go get the COVID test last night. I just hope that I get the results before we go to Toronto.

### [[CI]]
Even when sick and going off my original plan/schedule I need to make a new schedule taking how I feel into account rather than just ad libbing.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciated that Donna was so patient and helpful while I have been sick. 

### [[IMD]]
Just need to make a bit more of an effort when ill to not be grumpy.

### [[NK]]
It's been so weird having the kids be almost constantly sick the last two weeks. Although Rilka seems like she is back in business now. Amos just seems to be vacillating between mostly okay and a bit sick. Wish he could just kick it.

### [[RT]]
What is going on with this sore throat? And was there a way to avoid it? Would be nice to have some sort of documentation of that process.
