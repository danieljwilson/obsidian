### [[DW]]
Organizing the meetup with Dave and Julia and sharing the wine with them (and getting the wine in the first place).

### [[CI]]
Sunday night is a bit of an issue in terms of going to bed and it sets me up poorly for the week.

### [[GMD]]
I felt like our conversation about Donna's future plans last night went better than past conversation have. I still have a tendency to propose what seem like "solutions" to me, but I think that we are both getting better at seeing these as just "ideas" and not normative statements. 

### [[IMD]]
I have to think about how to react to Donna's body. I am looking forward to being done with the next kid so we can get back to something "normal"...

### [[NK]]
It as kind of fun just laying on the bed with Amos this morning. He seemed pretty content on his own as I tried to take a totally unsuccessful nap. Rilka likes to take out the boots and hand them to me and is really calm and relaxed when I put her into her snowsuit...

### [[RT]]
What happens with the US trip? Any downsides?? Kind of wish I hadn't told my mother.
