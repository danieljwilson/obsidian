Got journal set up in Obsdian and started figuring out how to take notes with it.

### [[CI]]
Need to spend more time going in depth on the note taking process for thesis.

I enjoyed when we were all outside yesterday afternoon. Donna was on duty and was really engaging with the kids - entertaining them in the back yard - and I finished up some work and came out around 5:30 and everyone just seemed to be having fun. Made me want to more mindfully appreciate the last moments of this first year.

### [[IMD]]
Tone, again. I am getting better but when Donna starts accepting my help/advice I am like an overeager dog, and push too hard. I need to back off and let her come to me.

I really like how independent Amos can be, he is just sitting touching a book behind me. Rilka was doing well for a moment but then lost her cool a bit. Just bored really. But it was interesting how she was so fussy for a couple of days after travel and now seems mainly back to normal.

### [[RT]]
Who are the people making Obsidian? I mean, what are they like? What is in it for them in terms of making it? Are they earning money?
