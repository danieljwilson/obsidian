The new Notion check list is pretty good. Better than the Obsidian version.

### [[CI]]
Need to still get my project management in line. It is weak atm.

### [[GMD]]
I think that it is neat that we are moving to a new city with two kids on Sunday and we are pretty relaxed about the whole thing. Granted it is not a "real" move in terms of furniture, etc., but I appreciate the flexibility we have as a family.

### [[IMD]]
I overreacted re: the mittens this morning. I think that I would have been better off just explaining that I would prefer to know in advance so there aren't any morning surprises.

### [[NK]]
Amos seemed to be on the verge of communicating what he wanted and didn't want when I offered him water this morning. They also both seemed to know how to sign "more" when I was offering them bites of my crispix. That was neat. Some of the first real senses that they are trying to communicate something in their heads "outwards"...

### [[RT]]
How will the new daycare be? Really hoping that it is 80% of what this one is...and will they be in an 8:1 ratio off the bat. Seems like a bit of a rude transition if so....
