Got the kids to school at a good time and did my stretching with them in the morning as well as some voice training.

I appreciate that Donna is so on the ball with considering the metrics/protocol for getting pregnant and maximizing our odds.

### [[IMD]]

Rilka is really aware of the steps involved in getting ready for daycare. She sat down so I would put on her pants and her socks and boots. And she lay flat on her back so I could zip up her jacket. Pretty funny. Amos has fallen in love with the fork knife travel combo and carried it around with him all morning.

### [[RT]]
Wish I could just watch versions of me that had taken different focuses. Art. Film. Writing. Programming. Math. Etc.
