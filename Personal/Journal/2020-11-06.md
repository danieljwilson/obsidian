### [[DW]]
Decided to get started on schedule at correct time today.

### [[CI]]
Early morning time is a bit scattered. Am doing other tasks before getting started on routine.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciate how Donna makes an effort to come hang out in bed before I go to sleep when she is still working (and it must be so tempting just to stay in bed).

### [[IMD]]
I think that I need to be a bit more proactive on Donna's droopy days. Even if I don't agree with what is making her droop.

### [[NK]]
Rilka went up on the couch last night, first putting the glass container of bananas on it, and then proceeded to stuff her mouth so full of banana that it was oozing out of her lips. Rilka has also started to do this thing where she drinks from her sippy cup and then lets out a bit "aaaah".

### [[RT]]
Do I need more break time in my schedule? Longer lunch? Would that make it easier to be on track?
