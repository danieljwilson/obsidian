Cut the kids nails this morning.

### [[CI]]
When I have these things that feel like deadlines I upend my schedule to work on them. Need to just have it be part of the schedule, and how much I get done is how much I get done. Otherwise other things start getting ignored.

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed the evening with Donna. I think that we were both pretty tired mentally and physically but having some food and wine and watching a silly TV show felt like an appropriate level of activity and a good level of connection.

### [[IMD]]
Some sort of card/written item re: the thesis completion would be nice - so I should make sure to do that when she actually submits her final version.

### [[NK]]
Amos pulled himself up into standing for the first time this morning on his little pin legs. So excited for them both to be walking! Also interesting how Amos is kind of a unconscious bully. Just grabs things and is strong. But without ill intent. Like the time he was trying to touch Rilka's eyeballs.

### [[RT]]
How to discipline kids/say no to certain things when they are really young. Amos tends to think that it is just a game. How to impress upon him/them that something is actually not allowed?
