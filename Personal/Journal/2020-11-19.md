### [[DW]]
Got started at 7:30 even though I hadn't done my other tasks first.

### [[CI]]
Get at least a couple of tasks done right away. Could do stretching if I want to be around the kids. Could be good so they get a bit of time with me before I go to the office.

### [[GMD]]
It was nice talking with Donna about the decisions she has on her plate while in bed last night. I still feel like we are a but bumbly/stumbly in these interactions but I think that we are **both** starting to feel a bit more open and receptive.

### [[IMD]]
I think that I should do a morning check in with Donna.

### [[NK]]
Rilka seems to go for the same books each time. One of which she doesn't even seem that interested in reading. Amos is still curling his feet and when he walks he likes to swing his legs out in front locked out straight like some sort of soldier.

### [[RT]]
What does Attiya really do with her days?
