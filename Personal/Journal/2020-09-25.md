### [[DW]]
Had a pretty good call with Cendri. Was able to stand up for pursuing risk. Now I just have to follow through.

### [[CI]]
I am not really nailing the schedule. Partly because it has some flaws (in particular my daily schedule) which I will address this weekend. i.e. leaving myself morning time each day.

### [[GMD]]
I appreciated when Donna made efforts to address comments I made in my +-+-+ immediately without even bringing it up. Along the same lines I appreciated that we were able to have a discussion about the exercise ball-seat situation that Donna proposed as a solution to her sitting situation - i.e. we could be on opposite sides of a topic but still keep some distance and not take things personally.

### [[IMD]]
I think that the exercise ball conversation could have been better. Focusing more on my needs and how having an exercise ball makes me feel.

### [[NK]]
I like how both kids almost immediately come over to climb on me as soon as start my core routine.

### [[RT]]
Does Alex/Dave think that I drink too much? How do they view my/our life in general? Curious.
