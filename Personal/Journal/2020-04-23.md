I have been doing a better job the last days capturing some footage of the twins playing.

Need to think more outside the box re: documentation. A time lapse would be a good idea.

I appreciated our Ozark watching last night. It’s fun to do a bit of analysis/guessing when sharing an experience like a medium/decent TV show. Especially when watching with someone with similar sensibilities. I was impressed when Donna correctly guessed that when Wyatt closed the fridge there would be someone standing there, and as soon as she said it knew that it was correct.

Again, didn’t do a real bedtime thing.

Rilka seems to be getting into “off roading”, enjoying crawling over piled up cushions and over us when we are lying down. And over Amos as well. He was laughing when she started interacting with him this morning - until she started trying to grab his eyeball.

It’s just hard to imagine Amos crawling. It is like we have one girl, one boy, one baby who crawls, one who doesn’t. I know, logically, that this will change. But I don’t see the path forward at this point . Whereas for Rilka it was so clear from the beginning when she started getting up on all fours.
