Another day getting up on time and getting in bed by 9:30pm

### [[CI]]
Why did I give myself a pass on the morning work session? If I need more time in the mornings I need to either schedule it in or get up earlier.

### [[GMD]]
I enjoyed the moment today when I opened the door of the kids room to reveal Donna pushing both kids around in the cardboard box and everyone looked really happy.

### [[IMD]]
Tone. I got a bit annoyed when the tape measure we have been using for the kids was not in its usual spot, knowing that she was the last to use it. And then it felt like she wasn't taking responsibility for misplacing it.

### [[NK]]
This morning they both kind of made mooing sound when reading the farmyard sounds book. Also Rilka knen where to go when Donna said lets read a book - heading to the box where the books are.

### [[RT]]
What is Sven's life like? Is he happy with how things are going? How does it feel to be t e breadwinner? Seems like Jaq just doesn't want to teach anymore...
