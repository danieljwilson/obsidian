### [[DW]]
Have improved my bedtime routine. Not perfect but a big move in the right direction.

### [[CI]]
I havenâ€™t really given Donna any help with her next steps. Could do a better job of looking for ideas.

### [[GMD]]
I think that it is nice that we both have the tendency/inclination to put ourselves out for the other person. Last night Donna took it on herself to sleep on the couch, knowing that I had moved the night before, but without me asking. I honestly would have been fine trying to do a night together again, but it was a generous gesture. 

### [[IMD]]
I should have acknowledged more quickly that the swim idea was not a good one. Donna was game to go along with it and not complain but it was not great.

### [[NK]]
Amos sat up on his own yesterday for the first time and is now doing it regularly today. Though he still sometimes goes over backwards and bonks his head as he tries to unfold his legs. Rilka also just went from the couch to the floor without tears but without us seeing how she did it... 

### [[RT]]
Amos seems to be very feet/legs centric. Will it parlay into foot/leg coordination? What else could I be doing to build coordination.
