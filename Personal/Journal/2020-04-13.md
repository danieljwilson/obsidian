### [[DW]]
Felt good during my hard/long workout on Sunday.

Slept in late on Saturday.

Worked on the app with Donna (making something that we could use as cue cards for the French words we have been accumulating)

### [[CI]]
Didn’t do any art stuff. Just kept pushing it. Not eating the frog. 

Still could improve on getting rested.

Donna seems like she is in  a good space these days and that definitely rubs off on me. I like hearing how she is getting things “done” - like the edits on her paper - because it also serves as motivation for me. I think that I am more attuned to my environment than might be readily apparent to outside observers, at least in the sense that I really get energised when I see people around me who are motivated and getting stuff done.

I also really like the song that she is making for the kids - the creativity and the sentiment are great. And the birthday itself was just a nice moment with her and my mother (and the kids).

### [[IMD]]
I think that I should do a better job of saving up my libido for Donna. Very easy to dispense with it during the day before a nap, but especially with her bids for intimacy as expressed in her daily notes, I need to be more thoughtful about this.

9 months old today. That’s neat.

Next winter where are we? What are the chances we are back here in Nice? With my mom? And do we ever go to Ireland with Dad??
