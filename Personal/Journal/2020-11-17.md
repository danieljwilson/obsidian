### [[DW]]
I am happy with the printing of the posters. And it was good to have them delivered instead of being impatient and picking them up.

### [[CI]]
This morning I got into email mode and have cut into my run time quite severely. Don't do that.

### [[GMD]]
I was a bit happy when yesterday it seemed like we may have found a good daycare in Montreal at a very reasonable price where we can start right away...felt like a potential "win" and it was fun to share it with Donna as I know that she is equally invested in this particular outcome...

### [[IMD]]
Maybe re-start the quotes at dinner? Just feel like there isn't a lot of actual talking.

### [[NK]]
Was fun seeing the video Crystal sent of Amos walking while holding onto the bar and her saying "1,2,1,2...". Rilka cried all the way home from daycare. Not sure if it is the cold? Hard to know how their comfort level is (hot/cold etc...).

### [[RT]]
What does Crystal think of Amos and Rilka, really? And what does she assume about us as parents??
