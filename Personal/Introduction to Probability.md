### Thoughts
Good but a bit high level for me. Made it all the way through but didn't have a lot of confidence in establishing the concepts in a deep way. Was basically muddling through each week. Did this with Donna which was helpful. It was doing this that inspired me to go back and learn more about stats, taking the actual class by watching the lectures and doing the class homework, which was frustrating and led me to decide to go back to learn calculus, which in turn inspired me to learn  algebra.
