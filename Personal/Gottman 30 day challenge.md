## Everyday Positivity
Saturday Aug 24 I was grateful for:
- having mother who would willingly look after the kids, and that we could be confident that they were all having a great day
- having a partner who likes to plan things with a whimsically complex mo
- the fact that Donna was up for hiking pretty fast even on pretty ankle-unfriendly terrain
- that we both got excited about a housing possibility in Montreal
- that the bowling alley was empty
- having someone both aligned and different to think about the future with

## Under our Nose
One thing that made me smile about Donna today was her easy going conversation with Yuill and Cammie's kids. It made me look forward to when we are going to be speaking to our own kids.

## Best Buds
My partner is a good friend to me. One way my partner shows they are a good friend is:
> I find that Donna makes an effort to notice things that I like, or would like base on observed tastes/proclivities. For example the gift of the airpod pros.

## Open-ended Questions
Ask:
- What makes you feel most proud in your job right now?
- If you could change something about our physical home, what would you choose and why?
- What do you want next year to be like for our family?

# 12
## Small Things Often
Notice 'bids': 
- Getting dinner after running
- Making banana bread
- Kids video in tub
- Offering to help with the IKEA stuff and then sweeping up after picking up the boxes
- Offering storage space

# 13
## Turning Towards
Try to make more of an effort to turn toward partner in novel ways.
"One way I respond positively to my partner is":
Tried to be better at stopping working when Donna is trying to engage.

## A Look Back
1. **What stood out this week?**
Looking back on the 11 days since arrival I think that two things stood out. How far we have come as a couple and how far we have to go. I think both can be viewed positively. First, I think that what could have been a more fraught time due to stress and fatigue and logistical challenges was much more manageable with some of our new communication skills. But I also often saw areas that could use improvement. As I have reached a point where I have already reached my max and am on the decline these areas of potential substantial improvement are great. 
2. **What changes (if any) have you noticed since beginning the challenge?**
I honestly don't think the challenge itself has predicated any real changes. But it has made me think about the importance of nurturing our relationship. I think that sometimes it can be easy to step back - especially when things are "pretty good" - but in the end it seems to me like another flywheel situation where regular small efforts get a much larger process moving - and keep it moving over time.
3. **What were some takeaways that you can implement into your relationship?**
I think that I can definitely do better about not turning away - be it intentional or not. More attuned to the bids Donna is making. And also more intentional in terms of coming up with activities and events for us to engage in/with.

## Checkpoint!
One thing I plan to focus on next week is turning toward and tone.

There is a lot of affection between me and my partner. One special way we like to connect is dinner and BK99.

# 16
## Saying Thanks
Task: Say thank you when appropriate.

I am thankful for my partner. One small thing I appreciate about my partner lately is how well she is balancing so many different demands and still being present and upbeat.

# 17
## Let's Get Specific
I appreciate how caring you are. Both on a small and large scale, like when you think of how the kids might like to play with the extra door stop - which they did - and when you care about bigger picture things like the under-priced externalities of flying.

I appreciate how inquisitive you are. You like to learn things across a wide range of subjects - like when I see you taking on things for SSG like the GIS assignment and also opting to use Python to solve a data problem as a way of developing greater facility for the language.

I appreciate how sexy you are. I feel like it is easy to potentially get a roommate feel when spending so much time in the same place as another person, but that doesn't happen with you. And not to put other mothers down, but when I see them sometimes I really appreciate your intention to get back to your "normal" self. I know there were various motivations for this but it does make a difference. I also like when you do things like get a pedicure.

## Getting Curious
Imagine what other options are available to you when you begin to make assumptions about your partner. What would it mean for you to consider curiosity rather than certainty about your partner's behavior?

One thing I feel compassionate about with my partner is the large amount of items on her plate this month. The thing that seems nice is that many of them are deadline based and so will be over, one way or another, by the end of month.
